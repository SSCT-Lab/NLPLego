( Norman : Nourmands ; French : Normands ; Latin : Normanni );who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name;to Normandy , a region;in France
( " Norman " comes from " Norseman " );from Denmark , Iceland and Norway
Through generations of assimilation and mixing;with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations
and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries
cultural and military
and eventually for their Christian piety , becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated
they settled , their dialect becoming known as Norman , Normaund or Norman French , an important literary language
which they formed by treaty;with the French crown;and under Richard I of Normandy;was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality;in feudal tenure
such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions;and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations
under Roger II;after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines;and an expedition;on behalf of their duke;William the Conqueror , led to the Norman conquest of England;at the Battle of Hastings;in 1066
and military;where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch;in the Levant;to Scotland and Wales;in Great Britain;to Ireland;and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands
plural of Normant;modern French normand , which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann " Northman " or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr , Latinized variously as Nortmannus , Normannus , or Nordmannus;( recorded in Medieval Latin , 9th century );to mean " Norseman , Viking "
In the course of the 10th century;into the rivers of France;that included local women and personal property
which began in 911;as a fiefdom;between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo;and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria
between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast;in exchange for their protection;against further Viking incursions
down to the river Seine
and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II;( part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis )
Before Rollo 's arrival;which were considered " Frankish "
but were divided between colonies;in the east;( Roumois and Pays de Caux );around the low Seine valley;and in the west;in the Cotentin Peninsula;and were separated by traditional pagii;where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers
who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast;Norwegians , Norse–Gaels , Orkney Vikings , possibly Swedes , and Anglo-Danes;from the English Danelaw;under Norse control
( Christianity );to synthesize a unique " Norman " culture in the north of France
by a Norse-speaking ruling class;and it developed into the regional language;that survives today
and worked them into a functional hierarchical system;in both Normandy;and in England
most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty
and land-hungry , and by 1066 Normandy;had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation
France and England;as avid Crusaders;under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart
Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy;and then Armenia , fighting against the Pechenegs , the Bulgars , and especially the Seljuk Turks
but they soon fought in Byzantine service;in Sicily
in 1038–40
and it now seems likely only a few came from there
as the Byzantines called them;and not other Frenchmen
to serve as a Byzantine general
By then however
under the Byzantine duke of Antioch , Isaac Komnenos
In the 1060s;against the Turks
in Asia Minor;with support;from the local population;but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos
in far eastern Anatolia
Later;further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains
named Oursel;in northern Syria
From 1073 to 1074;formerly of Oursel;led by Raimbaud
Afranji , meaning " Franks;"
known;and between Bari and Tarsus;in those cities;while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule;in Italy
during the period of the Comnenian Restoration;when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors
were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps;and that group of Albanian clans;known as the Maniakates;were descended from Normans;who served under George Maniaces;in the Sicilian expedition of 1038
an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia;as the result of his military successes
Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal
After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia;in 1081;capturing Valona , Kanina , Jericho;( Orikumi );and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages
devastating everything along the way
Under these harsh circumstances;against the Normans
because it had started;before their arrival
Immediately before the battle;in the coast surrounding the city
Forced to retreat;named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium
by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants;who had settled there
The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland;in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly;before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica
among the high ranks
Valona , and Butrint in 1085;after the death of Robert
A few years after the First Crusade;in 1107;under the command of Bohemond;using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time;but to no avail
Meanwhile;the citadel of Mili;at the banks of the river Deabolis , Gllavenica;( Ballsh );Kanina and Jericho
This time;dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them
With their help;and opened their way to Dibra
in the city of Deabolis
in 1185;owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials
Some time later;one of the most important naval bases of the Adriatic
from an early date
the English coasts;opposite England;across the English Channel
through the marriage of Emma , sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy;and King Ethelred II of England
Because of this;in 1013;when he was forced from his kingdom;by Sweyn Forkbeard
( until 1016 );who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great 's conquest;of the isle
When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father 's refuge;in 1041;at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut
also;some of whom;established an English cavalry force
but it is a typical example;of the attitudes of Edward
of Canterbury;and made Ralph the Timid earl;of Hereford
Count of Boulogne;an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex
In 1066;killing King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings
invading;and their descendants
and many had lands;on both sides of the channel
as Dukes of Normandy;for their land;on the continent
( it brought with it the title of King — an important status symbol )
Eventually;combining languages and traditions
In the course of the Hundred Years ' War
something that was the subject;of some humour;by Geoffrey Chaucer
( see Old English ) and influenced it , helping ( along with the Norse language of the earlier Anglo-Norse settlers and the Latin used by the church ) in the development of Middle English
in turn
after their invasion;at Bannow Bay;in 1169

Yet;with time;they
later known as the Pale , and also built many fine castles and settlements , including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle

such as French , ( De ) Roche , Devereux , D ' Arcy , Treacy and Lacy;especially in the southern part of County Wexford;where the first Norman settlements were established
such as Furlong
( Murrell )
beginning with;( from the Norman for son )
FitzGibbons ( Gibbons ) dynasty , Fitzmaurice
Other;bearing such surnames as Barry ( de Barra ) and De Búrca;( Burke );also
opposing William the Conqueror
and came into opposition;to William;who had already disputed Scotland 's southern borders
riding as far as Abernethy;where he met up with his fleet of ships
beginning a series of arguments;as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England
building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings , such as Robert the Bruce , as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans
whose elder brother Alexander I had;of Normandy;part of the process some scholars call the " Davidian Revolution "
Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England;( married to David 's sister Maud of Scotland );and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair
most intensely of all under William the Lion

of the names Bruce , Gray , Ramsay , Fraser , Ogilvie , Montgomery , Sinclair , Pollock , Burnard , Douglas and Gordon;to name but a few , and including the later royal;House of Stewart
Even before the Norman Conquest of England
and charged him with defending the Marches and warring with the Welsh
In these original ventures
Subsequent to the Conquest;however;including Bernard de Neufmarché , Roger of Montgomery in Shropshire and Hugh Lupus;in Cheshire
during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject;to Norman interference
such as baron;( barwn )
long;before the First Crusade carved out a Norman principality in Antioch
in Iberia
In 1018;but failed
In 1064;during the War of Barbastro
In 1096

with the so-called " Winchester school ";which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy
In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century;but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function;after the midpoint of the century
in the 16th century and French Revolution;in the 18th

in theoretical computer science;that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other
that is in principle amenable;to being solved by a computer;which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps;such as an algorithm
whatever the algorithm used
to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them;such as time and storage
such as the amount of communication;( used in communication complexity );the number of gates;in a circuit ( used in circuit complexity ) and the number of processors;( used in parallel computing )
on what computers can
Closely related;of algorithms and computability theory
whereas the latter asks a more general question;about all possible algorithms;that could be used to solve the same problem
More precisely
In turn;on the available resources;the latter theory;asks what kind of problems can;in principle;be solved algorithmically
together with a solution;for every instance
and should not be confused with the problem itself
In computational complexity theory
In contrast;which can serve as the input;for a decision problem
For example
( e.g. 15 );if the number is prime and " no " otherwise;( in this case " no " )
Stated another way;corresponding to the given input
When considering computational problems
Usually;( i.e. , the set { 0,1 } );and thus the strings are bitstrings
As in a real-world computer;other than bitstrings
For example;and graphs can be encoded directly;via their adjacency matrices;or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary
in computational complexity theory
whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0
where the members of the language are instances;whose output is yes;and the non-members are those instances;whose output is no
whether a given input string is a member;of the formal language;under consideration
If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes;otherwise it is said to reject the input



The formal language associated with this decision problem is then;the set of all connected graphs;to obtain a precise definition of this language
where a single output ( of a total function ) is expected for every input;but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem;that is , it is n't just yes or no
and the integer factorization problem

since function problems can be recast as decision problems
For example;( a , b , c );such that the relation a × b = c holds

To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem
However;in general
to solve
( or the space required , or any measure of complexity )
in bits

For instance;with 2n vertices;with n vertices
If the input size is n
Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different;worst-case time
If T(n) is a polynomial in n;then
if it admits a polynomial time algorithm
of a general computing machine
that manipulates symbols;contained on a strip of tape
but rather as a thought experiment;representing a computing machine;anything;from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician;with a pencil and paper


Furthermore;such as a RAM machine , Conway 's Game of Life , cellular automata or any programming language
Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically , and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation
deterministic;which uses a fixed set of rules;to determine its future actions

to make probabilistic decisions often;more efficiently
that use random
which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions;from a given state
and if it solves the problem in any of these branches
Clearly;that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes
For examples
such as deterministic Turing machines , probabilistic Turing machines , non-deterministic Turing machines , quantum Turing machines , symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines
but when resources ( such as time or space ) are bounded
Many;for example;random access machines
Perhaps surprisingly

all these models have in common

For example;non-deterministic;that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once
but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze;so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems
using a given amount of time and space;such as the deterministic Turing machine
or steps , the machine makes;before it halts and outputs the answer;( " yes " or " no " )
if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n)
if there exists a Turing machine;operating in time f(n);that solves the problem
Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems;based on their difficulty
For instance;within time f(n);on a deterministic Turing machine

Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources

Other;circuit complexity , and decision tree complexity
( or any other complexity measure )
Since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others
For example
that is given as the input
and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case
If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely
when each pivoting divides the list in half , also needing O(n log n) time
To classify the computation time;( or similar resources , such as space consumption );required by the most efficient algorithm;solving a given problem
unless specified otherwise

To show an upper bound T(n) on the time complexity of a problem;needs to show only
However;since lower bounds make a statement;about all possible algorithms;that solve a given problem
known today;but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future
To show a lower bound of T(n);for a problem
lower;which hides constant factors and smaller terms

For instance;if T(n) = 7n2 + 15n + 40;in big O notation
Of course;that do not fit into this framework
Thus;typical;like the following
often;that depend on the chosen machine model
For instance;{ xx | x is any binary string };but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines
If we allow polynomial variations;in running time;( Goldreich 2008 , Chapter 1.2 )
for the complexity class P;which is the set of decision problems solvable;by a deterministic Turing machine;within polynomial time

Many important;used by the algorithm
defined in this
Other important;AC and NC;which are defined using Boolean circuits;and BQP and QMA;which are defined using quantum Turing machines
( not decision problems )
like IP and AM

For the complexity classes;defined in this way;( say )
In particular;although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2)
For time and space requirements;respectively
because they induce a proper hierarchy;on the classes;defined by constraining the respective resources
Thus;such that one is properly included in the other
Having deduced such proper set inclusions;that can be solved
for most separation results of complexity classes
For instance;that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME;and the space hierarchy theorem tells us;that L is strictly contained in PSPACE

into another problem

For instance;if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y
such as Cook reductions , Karp reductions and Levin reductions;and the bound on the complexity of reductions;such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions
most commonly;polynomial-time

For example
for multiplying two integers

since squaring can be reduced to multiplication

if every problem in C can be reduced to X
Thus;since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C
Of course
For complexity classes larger than P
In particular
If a problem X is in C and hard;for C;then

Since many problems could be equally hard
Thus;in the sense;that they are the ones most likely not to be in P
Because the problem P = NP is not solved;being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem , Π2;to another problem;Π1
because;polynomial-time;polynomial-time
because all NP problems can be reduced to the set
complexity;that admit an efficient algorithm

complexity;on the other hand;but for which no efficient algorithm is known , such as the Boolean satisfiability problem , the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem
Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines
in theoretical computer science;because of the wide implications;of a solution
If the answer is yes
many problems in logistics , protein structure prediction in biology , and the ability;to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems
versus NP problem;proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute

that are neither in P nor NP-complete

the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem
or to be NP-complete
graph isomorphism;the computational problem


If graph isomorphism is NP-complete
Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level;it is believed that
due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks;with n vertices
of determining the prime factorization of a given integer
Phrased as a decision problem
and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems;such as the RSA algorithm
and in co-NP;( and even in UP and co-UP )
If the problem is NP-complete;( i.e. , NP will equal co-NP )
best known;which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3);to factor an n-bit integer
However;best known;for this problem
about where the problem lies with respect
Many known;but this has not been proved
For instance;P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE
If P is not equal to NP;either
Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE;such as RP , BPP , PP , BQP , MA , PH , etc.

Along the same lines;( i.e. problems with the yes/no answers reversed )
however , it has not yet been proven

( the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space )
Again;such as NL and NC;and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes
( e.g. , given large but finite time );but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful
In complexity theory;that lack polynomial-time solutions
In fact
that are known to be intractable in this;that are EXPTIME-hard
If NP is not the same as P
To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in
For small n , say 100 , and assuming for the sake of example;that the computer does 1012 operations each second;which is the same order;of magnitude;as the age of the universe
Even with a much faster computer;and in that sense;the intractability of a problem is somewhat;independent of technological progress

If its running time is , say , n15;and it is still useless except on small instances
What intractability means in

For example;yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times;in most cases
Similarly;in less than quadratic time;and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem
Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off
Most;by Alan Turing;in 1936;which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer
As Fortnow & Homer ( 2003 ) point out;";On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms ";by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns;( 1965 );which laid out the definitions of time and space complexity and proved the hierarchy theorems
Also;in 1965;with running time;bounded by a polynomial of the input size

Somewhat earlier;( 1956 );a pioneer in the field;from the USSR
Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding

In 1967;the so-called , speed-up theorem
when the US researcher Stephen Cook and , working independently , Leonid Levin in the USSR , proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete
In 1972;" Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems ";in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems , each infamous for its computational intractability , are NP-complete

A few weeks after the deal
since it believed Rupert Murdoch 's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal

that included using high-pressure steam;which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency
and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives
and most practical steam engines;to recycle or top up the boiler water;so that they may be run continuously
Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps;however
which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler
but are no longer widely used , except in applications;such as steam locomotives
( described above );to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency



for each expansion stage
As with the double expansion engine;if space is at a premium;then
typically;but various other formations were used
In the late 19th century
between two cylinders;one at each end of the engine
resulting in a smoother , faster-responding engine;which ran with less vibration
with large passenger liners;( such as the Olympic class )
In the 1840s and 50s;to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate;riding on the back of the main slide valve;the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff
at the expense of increased friction and wear
usual;to overlap the port on the admission side;after cut-off;on the admission side;has occurred

Near the end of the 19th century compound engines
to accommodate the higher volumes;at reduced pressures , giving improved efficiency
especially in shipping;where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried
until the early 20th century;when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating ( piston ) steam engines;with shipping;in the 20th-century;relying upon the steam turbine
starting in the late part of the 19th century
( for outputs above several hundred horsepower );have fewer moving parts , and provide rotary power directly;instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means
virtually;early in the 20th century;where their efficiency , higher speed appropriate to generator service , and smooth rotation were advantages

With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement;with the HP one;at 135°;to the other two;or in some cases;all three cranks were set at 120°
In most reciprocating piston engines;at each stroke;( counterflow );entering and exhausting from the cylinder;by the same port
the cycle also comprises four events admission , expansion , exhaust , compression
to the cylinder;the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end ( s ) and are driven by valve gear;of which there are many types
arising from the usual counterflow cycle;where;during each stroke;the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam;whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy;in restoring working temperature
uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke
By this means;simple-expansion;with the added advantage of superior part-load performance , and comparable efficiency;to turbines;for smaller engines;below one thousand horsepower
However;practical difficulties

Instead of valves;such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot;mounting;( trunnion )
because of their simplicity;but have also been used in full size working engines;mainly on ships;where their compactness is valued
working;where the working fluid is recycled continuously , or may be an " open loop " system;where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere;and a separate source of water;feeding the boiler;is supplied
Normally;due to its favourable properties;such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry , abundance , low cost , and its thermodynamic properties



Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid , the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small;in steam turbines;( the creep limit of stainless steel )

to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling;by British engineer Arthur Woolf;who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805
In the compound engine;high-pressure;from the boiler;( HP );then;one or more subsequent lower-pressure ( LP ) cylinders
and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less;heat is lost by the steam;in each
increasing the efficiency of the engine
By staging the expansion;in multiple cylinders
as this steam occupies a greater volume
Therefore;and often the stroke;resulting in larger cylinders
( in the 1990s about 90 % of the world 's electric production was by use of steam turbines ) however;the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage;to the 80 % regime;for steam turbines
In electricity production;connected to their driving turbines
In marine service;( pioneered on the Turbinia );with reduction gearing;( although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox );being more efficient ( and requiring far less maintenance ) than reciprocating steam engines
In recent decades;for marine applications

equipped with high-pressure steam
Reciprocating;until the early 20th century;when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating ( piston ) steam engines in commercial usage , and the ascendancy;of steam turbines;in power generation
Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines;far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century
steam-powered;developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery
which was used to raise water from below;then;to raise it higher
though larger models were problematic
to boiler explosions
pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery

";to render it capable of working itself ";as described by John Smeaton;in the Philosophical Transactions;published in 1751


Around 1800 Richard Trevithick and , separately , Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines;using high-pressure steam
and could be made small enough;for transport applications
Thereafter;and improvements in manufacturing techniques;( partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source );or more powerful , depending on the intended application
Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use
in Sweden

( wet );this water is kept separate;from the condensate;which circulates in a closed system and returns;to the boiler
often;due to the evaporated water;condensing into droplets;carried up by the warm air
than " once-through " cooling by river or lake water;a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling , but would need about twenty times as much;if cooled by river water
in 1788;after Watt 's partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building
because it would assume a new constant speed in response;to load changes
such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler
whenever there was a speed change
As a consequence;were not suitable for operations;requiring constant speed;such as cotton spinning
and coupled with variable steam cut off , good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century
The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units;for road engines and almost universal;for marine engines;after 1880;where it was often perceived as complicated
afforded by the loading gauge;( particularly in Britain , where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930 )
However;although never in the majority
simplest;during the engine cycle;and often make the engine rotate in only one direction
which additionally can provide means;for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually " shortening the cutoff " or rather , shortening the admission event;this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period
However;as one;and the same valve usually controls both steam flows;a short cutoff;at admission;adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods;which should ideally always be kept fairly constant;if the exhaust event is too brief;( " kick back " )

In the vast majority of large electric generating stations;with no reduction gearing
( RPM );in Europe;and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems
In nuclear power applications
when rotating in one direction



However;so that indirectly the world 's industry is still dependent on steam power
Recent;both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover

based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the Wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine
from the time of James Watt to the present day , but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production;see link;at bottom of article;for more details
to make them steam-tight;in the face of wear and thermal expansion;the resulting leakage made them very inefficient

when James Watt developed ( 1763–1775 ) an improved version of Newcomen 's engine;with a separate condenser
early engines

generated by condensing steam;instead of the pressure;of expanding steam
because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure
for ensuring;one may be adjusted by the user , the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe

that restrained the valve against steam pressure
leading to many accidents;when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power;from the engine
which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken

patented in 1849;which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff
When Corliss was given the Rumford medal
In addition to using 30 % less steam;due to variable steam cut off;making it well suited;to manufacturing , especially cotton spinning
however , the only applications;of scientific theory;that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts;of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam
made by Watt on a model steam
independently;which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black;who also advised Watt on experimental procedures
with pressure
to the engine
needed to calculate efficiency;which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine

By condensing the fluid;required by the pump;for a real cycle
due to the lower heat addition
for instance;approaching 1500 °C

Other components are often present;( such as an injector );during operation;to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation;to raise the temperature of the steam;above its saturated vapour point;to increase the draft;for fireboxes
When coal is used;and its drive engine or motor may;( bunker )

Elsewhere;notably in the U.S.A. , more advanced designs;but not reproduced

but nevertheless;source;released in combustion

and therefore the design and manufacture of O2 systems requires special training to ensure;that ignition sources are minimized

For example
In 1805;and by 1811;Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water 's composition;based on what is now called Avogadro 's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules
that leave little residue;such as wood or coal;whereas non-combustible substances;that corrode;such as iron;contained very little

in Uppsala;in 1773 or earlier;and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire;in 1774;but Priestley is often given priority;because his work was published first
by Antoine Lavoisier;whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion

although the Council is the " de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives "

For " enhanced cooperation ";among a sub-set of at least member states

In fact;( the English Court of Appeal , the German Bundesgerichtshof , the Belgian Cour du travail , etc. );but they can refer questions to the EU court;for a preliminary ruling
although realistically it has the ability;to expand and develop the law;according to the principles it deems to be appropriate
Arguably;Mangold v Helm , and Kadi v Commission
Since its founding
both;between different systems
Within the EU itself
In the first major case;in 1964;a Milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named Mr Costa;as a protest;against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations
and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice;under TFEU article 267
because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force;from 1958
By contrast
However;in principle;and the court would have a duty;to consider his claim to make a reference;if there would be no appeal against its decision
repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos;said;and created a body of law applicable;both to their nationals;and to themselves;on the " basis of reciprocity "
however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question

Similarly;in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA;Simmenthal SpA
In " accordance;with the principle of the precedence of Community law;";" directly;of the institutions;" ( such as the Regulations in the case ) ";"
undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states
But despite the views of the Court of Justice
Generally speaking , while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties
In the United Kingdom
to withdraw from the EU
( Factortame Ltd );that " whatever limitation of its sovereignty;Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary " and so " it has always been clear ";with any directly enforceable rule of Community law
More recently;( HS2 Action Alliance Ltd );although the UK constitution is uncodified;and Parliament " did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation " of those principles;when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972
( particularly democracy , the rule of law and the social state principles )
However;as the nicknames of the judgments go;" so long as " the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions , and has a framework;that protects fundamental human rights;for compatibility;with German constitutional principles
Most other
to human rights;and the democratic will;of the people
While constitutional law concerns the European Union 's governance structure
( locus standi );against EU institutions and other member states;for breach of the treaties
From the EU 's foundation;if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations
However;under Directives;against other non-state parties
even though the member state government could be sued;if it would impose an obligation;on another citizen or corporation
on " direct effect "
and judged by standards of proportionality , particularly where general principles of law , or fundamental rights are engaged
where there has been a breach;of the law;but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction;in order to ensure the law is effective;as possible
Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy;not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims :
( and EU Regulations );if they are ( 1 ) clear and unambiguous ( 2 ) unconditional , and ( 3 ) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them
charging tariffs
After a Dutch court made a reference
for their enforcement
Because article 30 clearly , unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade;without a good justification;it paid for the tariff
in this sense;because as TFEU article 288 states , they are ' directly applicable in all Member States '
Moreover;in order to prevent confusion
For instance;( to reduce dairy overproduction )
solely by virtue of their publication;and implementation could have the effect of " jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union;"
On the other hand;in which case;those specific rules should be followed
While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect;( if clear , unconditional and immediate );( as opposed to the member state )
In theory;to implement

For example;but most member states require more than 28 days;in national law
However;on the current position;adopted by the Court of Justice;that implement Directives;but not from Directives themselves
( i.e. between non-state parties )

but there are five large exceptions
First;if a Directive 's deadline for implementation is not met;and a citizen may rely on the Directive;in such an action;( so called " vertical " direct effect )
So;in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline
to perform the obligations;which the Directive entails
Second;not just in a dispute;with a public authority;but in a dispute;with another citizen or company
So;that it had not complied with a Belgian decree;from 1991;about alarm systems;on the basis;that it had not been notified to the Commission;as a Directive required
Third;if a Directive gives expression;to a " general principle " of EU law;before its deadline;for implementation
Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice;before dismissal
from age 18 to 28;for Swedex GmbH & Co KG;before her dismissal

because equality was also a general principle;of EU law
Third;if the defendant is an emanation of the state , even if not central government;still
which made women retire at age 60;and men at 65;if ( 1 ) pursuant to a state measure , ( 2 ) it provided a public service , and ( 3 ) had special powers
as it was held with a water company;that was responsible for basic water provision
Fourth;" as far as possible;in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive;"
( though not the Court itself )
that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons

But , fifth;if a member state has failed to implement a Directive;against other non-state parties;but can sue the member state itself for failure;to implement the law
So;in Francovich v Italy;as the Insolvency Protection Directive required
the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm;from the Italian government;in damages;for his loss

that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament
which have been developed by the European Court of Justice;that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how European Union law is interpreted and applies
In formulating these principles;including : public international law and legal doctrines and principles present;in the legal systems of European Union member states;and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights
( see human rights );proportionality , legal certainty , equality;before the law and subsidiarity
since the 1950s
According to the general principle of proportionality
When there is a choice between several appropriate measures;and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued

since the 1960s
which predates European Union law

which will have legal effect in the European Union
who are subject to the law
In European Union law;before they are published
which has its roots;in the principles of legal certainty and good faith;in European Union law
on the basis of law;as it is or seems to be
as in human rights;in the late 60s;and fundamental rights are now regarded as integral part of the general principles of European Union law
As;to the member states
Therefore;which are incompatible with fundamental rights;recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states
on which the member states have collaborated or of which they are signatories;which should be followed within the framework of Community law
establishing the European Union;for fundamental rights
that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions , to be subject;to human rights

as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states ' constitution became ever more apparent
In 1999;which could form the constitutional basis;for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions
from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties
( 1 );that " The Union recognises the rights , freedoms and principles;set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000;as adopted at Strasbourg;on 12 December 2007;which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties;"
Therefore;codifying the fundamental rights;which were previously considered general principles of European Union law
In effect;though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice;in relation to European Union measures , and the latter;by the European Court of Human Rights;in relation;to measures;by member states
covering social policy issues in European Union law
by the " social partners " representatives;namely UNICE , the employers ' confederation , the European Trade Union Confederation ( ETUC ) and CEEP;the European Centre of Public Enterprises
toned;at the 1989 Strasbourg European Council
including on fair remuneration of employment , health and safety at work , rights of disabled and elderly , the rights;of workers;on vocational training and improvements of living conditions

such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing
between firms;( the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC )

but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies

While the concept of a " social market economy " was only introduced into EU law;in 2007;since the Treaty of Rome 1957

In Europe;and it remains unclear;whether the " endgame " should be the same as a state , traditionally understood
( particularly big business ) much more;than others;but will burden people;who lack bargaining power in an expanding market , particularly workers , consumers , small business , developing industries , and communities
on the Functioning of the European Union;while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons , services and capital
( e.g. customs );( e.g. differing laws on safety , consumer or environmental standards );( e.g. different Value Added Tax rates )

Although many companies , including Mr Schmidberger 's German undertaking , were prevented from trading;against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced , and was probably subordinate
If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification
( 1 );( 2 ) be necessary , so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result , and ( 3 ) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests;in article 36
Often;but may have a greater practical effect;on imports than domestic products
such " indirect " discriminatory ( or " indistinctly applicable " ) measures;the Court of Justice;has developed more justifications :;either those in article 36 , or;additional " mandatory " or " overriding " requirements;such as consumer protection;improving labour standards , protecting the environment , press diversity , fairness;in commerce;and more :;the categories
In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein;( not just imported ones );because it had a greater negative effect;on imports
but Cassis de Dijon;which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France;only
that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36;because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling
about a product 's content or packaging
infringed article 34
that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped;it would " considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view " and labelling would protect consumers " just as effectively "
In a 2003 case;that

but British , Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats




If member states place considerable obstacles;on the use of a product
So , in a 2009 case , Commission v Italy
Again;but disproportionately affected importers;because Italian companies did not make trailers
it would have " a considerable influence;on the behaviour of consumers;";that " affects the access of that product to the market "
under article 36;or as a mandatory requirement
In contrast to product requirements or other laws;that hinder market access;if they applied equally to all sellers , and affected them in the same manner;in fact
which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price

as " in law and in fact " it was an equally applicable;";" ( not something that alters a product 's content ) it was outside the scope of article 34 , and so did not need to be justified
";in fact;" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market;but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing
under age 12;and misleading commercials;for skin care products
While the bans have remained;( justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement ) the Court;[ a trader ]
where advertising was the only way;for sellers to overcome consumers ' " traditional social practices and to local habits and customs " to buy their products;but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36;to protect public health
Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive;to forbid conduct;that distorts average consumer behaviour , is misleading or aggressive , and sets out a list of examples;that count as unfair
Increasingly;while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice
while allowing consumers access to goods;from around the continent
Since its foundation;in any country;through free movement
Reflecting the economic nature of the project;originally;as a " factor of production "
However;from the 1970s
so that people had rights;to empower them to become economically and socially active;rather than economic activity being a precondition;for rights
in TFEU article;as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens;in TFEU articles
According to the Court of Justice;in an employment relationship;" under the direction of another person ";for " remuneration "
however;for someone to be protected as a worker
For example;in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie;while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community;which provided;for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions
for the work he did
by governments;and employers , in access;to employment , tax , and social security rights
By contrast;who is " any person;having the nationality of a Member State ";( TFEU article 20 ( 1 ) );vote;but more restricted rights;to claim social security
In practice;as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears;about immigrants taking away people 's jobs and benefits;( paradoxically at the same time )
on wages and employment of local workers
on equal treatment of workers

In a famous case;when his contract finished;regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees
[ d ];and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest;but this was unlikely
but only if the measure was not disproportionate
By contrast;in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA;in;that could only be obtained in Bolzano
giving " horizontal " direct effect to TFEU article 45;and because it was " impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means ";the measure was disproportionate
( 2 );in respect of tax
( e.g. for married couples , and social insurance expense deductions );who worked in Germany , but was resident in Belgium;when other German residents got the benefits
By contrast;in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg
because the charge applied equally to Austrians;in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified
Third;although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods
because the benefit was " closely linked to the socio-economic situation " of the Netherlands
living in the Netherlands;but was resident in Austria could
general;( 3 );" public;public security or public health " , and there is also a general exception in article 45 ( 4 ) for " employment;in the public service;"
by the Court of Justice;and has accordingly increased the number of social services;that people can access wherever they move
albeit with qualifying periods
( mainly German );because there was little evidence;of an actual problem
As well as creating rights;for " workers ";who generally lack bargaining power in the market;on the Functioning of the European Union;in article 49;and " freedom to provide services " in article 56
In Gebhard v Consiglio;while providing " services " meant pursuing activity more " on a temporary basis "
who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council;for not having registered;rather than service freedom
However;" justified by imperative requirements in the general interest " and proportionately applied
particularly the self-employed , or " undertakings ";such as companies or firms

because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified
when they exercise " official authority ";but this did an advocate 's work ( as opposed to a court 's ) was not official
unless there was an agreement;with a client

Therefore;of establishment;that needed to be justified
In 2006;off the coast of Côte d ' Ivoire;from a European ship

With countries;such as Spain not even having a crime;against shipping toxic waste;Frattini , the Justice , Freedom and
at the Court of Justice;resulting in a victory;for the Commission
something never done before
So far;only other
against that legislation;but was rejected at vote
However;in October 2007
who give services " for remuneration;" , especially commercial or professional activity
For example;in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de;while advising a client in a social security case;and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice
and the rule was probably unjustified :;having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice
because usually the state funds it;though higher education does not


so she argued this restricted the freedom;( of the German health clinic );to provide services
and should not fall within article 56
But;even though the government ( rather than the service recipient ) paid for the service
for medical services;abroad;if the health care received at home was without undue delay;and it followed " international medical science " on which treatments counted as normal and necessary
and this is also true in the context of the UK 's National Health Service
Aside from public services
( but not Dutch nationals );going to coffee shops
and so this differed from other cases;where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction
If an activity does fall within article 56;developed by the Court of Justice
In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën a business;that;( with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms );that prohibiting cold calling customers
including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence;in the Dutch markets
In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn
but residents had protested against " playing at killing " entertainment
which underpinned the ban;to provide services
that had sold internet gambling services;where people 's views were highly divergent
as this was an appropriate and necessary way;to tackle the serious problems of fraud;that arise over the internet
In the Services Directive
In regard;to companies;( Daily Mail and General Trust plc )
parent;in the UK
as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised
By contrast
while Denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone ( around €27,000 ) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent
because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services;in Denmark;without being established there;and there were less restrictive means;of achieving the aim of creditor protection
and a race to the bottom;in standards;like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result
that it was not validly incorporated in Germany
Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work;or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far :
However , in Cartesio Oktató;again;that because corporations are created by law , they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose
while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary
Thus;( where restrictions must be justified );and the right of the state;to determine conditions;for companies;incorporated in its territory;although it is not entirely clear why
( Portuguese : Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia ; Spanish : Selva Amazónica , Amazonía or usually Amazonia ; French : Forêt amazonienne ; Dutch : Amazoneregenwoud );also known in English;as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle;that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America
( 2,700,000 sq mi );of which 5,500,000 square kilometres ( 2,100,000 sq mi ) are covered by the rainforest
belonging to nine nations
with 60 % of the rainforest;followed by Peru with 13 %;Colombia with 10 %;and with minor amounts;in Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia , Guyana , Suriname and French Guiana
or departments in four nations
and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest;in the world;with an estimated 390 billion individual trees;divided into 16,000 species
Following;Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event

During the Oligocene;for example
during the Middle Miocene
However;allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species
During the mid-Eocene

As the Andes Mountains rose;however;now known as the Solimões Basin
Within the last 5–10 million years;joining the easterly flow;toward the Atlantic
( LGM )
and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover;in the basin

scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia;separated by open forest and grassland;than is seen today
because the practical limitations;and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data
NASA 's CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust;transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon :;out of the Sahara;at 15 degrees west longitude;across 1,600 miles ( 2,600 km ) over the Atlantic Ocean;( some dust falls into the Atlantic );at 35 degrees West longitude;at the eastern coast of South America;( 15 % );past 75 degrees west longitude
For a long time;as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil
of this idea;as;Man and Culture;in a Counterfeit Paradise

and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye;from outer space
Between 1991 and 2000;rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres;( 160,000 to 227,000 sq mi );with most of the lost forest becoming pasture;for cattle
and 91 % of land;deforested since 1970
Currently;after the United States
conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al.;the less precipitation reaches the area;and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes
So despite the popular perception;from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields
that are currently developing in the Amazon

mean;from 2000 to 2005;( 22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year );( 19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year )
Although deforestation has declined significantly in the Brazilian Amazon;between 2004 and 2014
that will result from destruction of the forest;and also about the release of the carbon;contained within the vegetation;which could accelerate global warming
in ecosystems;of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon

leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover;in the basin;by 2100
However;across many different models;ranging from weak increases to strong decreases

because they specialize in different types of prey;which they capture by as wide a range of methods;as spiders use
a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm;meaning it can fertilize its own egg;not needing a mate
which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time
in which the eggs and sperm mature;at different times
although platyctenids ' eggs are fertilized inside their parents ' bodies and kept there until they hatch
and in most species;gradually changing into their adult shapes;as they grow
whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles;whose young live as cydippid-like plankton;until they reach near-adult size
In at least some species;before reaching the adult size and shape

but in other places;they are uncommon and difficult to find
In bays;where they occur in very high numbers;by ctenophores;such as copepods;which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton;( planktonic plants );which are a vital part of marine food chains
accidentally;where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms;that would otherwise have fed the fish
such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes;that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population
as Beroe preys on other ctenophores
as far back as the early Cambrian
in the evolutionary family tree of animals;has long been debated;at present;based on molecular phylogenetics

in other words;because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants;of various cydippids
that is more complex than sponges , about as complex as cnidarians;( jellyfish , sea anemones , etc. );and less complex than bilaterians;( which include almost all other animals )
Unlike sponges;bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes;muscles;nervous systems;and some have sensory organs
which are sticky and adhere to prey;although a few ctenophore species lack them
Like sponges and cnidarians;that sandwich a middle layer;of jelly-like material;which is called the mesoglea;in cnidarians and ctenophores;more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer

Both;that;in more complex animals;arises from the middle cell layer;and as a result;some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic;while others still regard them as diploblastic
Ranging from about 1 millimeter ( 0.039 in ) to 1.5 meters;( 4.9 ft );in size;that use cilia ( " hairs " ) as their main method of locomotion
called comb rows;that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia , called " ctenes , " stacked along the comb rows;so that when the cilia beat , those of each comb touch the comb below

In other parts of the canal system;and furthest from the organ;that it supplies
( internal compartments );that produce eggs or sperm;and photocytes that produce bioluminescence
that circulate water through the canals;punctuated by ciliary rosettes;pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea

( the " oral pole " );to the opposite end;( the " aboral pole " );and are spaced more or less evenly around the body;although spacing patterns vary by species;and in most species;the comb rows extend only part of the distance;from the aboral pole;towards the mouth
( also called " ctenes " or " comb plates " );and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters;( 0.079 in )
these;where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function
although they can also reverse direction
in which the mouth is pointing , unlike jellyfish
When trying to escape predators;some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior;by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia

Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater;to reduce its volume and increase its density

Instead;in other words;the overall state of the nervous system
For example;if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey;spinning the mouth towards the prey
that are more or less rounded , sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped;the common coastal " sea gooseberry , " Pleurobrachia , sometimes has an egg-shaped body;with the mouth;at the narrow end;although some individuals are more uniformly round
From opposite sides of the body;each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn
so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles
( " little tentacles " );although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches
that capture prey by sticking to it
with vesicles;( chambers );that contain adhesive;a stalk;that anchors the cell;in the lower layer of the epidermis;or in the mesoglea;and a spiral thread;that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head;and to the root of the stalk
but it may absorb stress;when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart
to colloblasts;which feed mainly on jellyfish;for defense
a cell type otherwise unknown;in the phylum Ctenophora;and they are coiled when relaxed;while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed
that are used in capturing prey :;( in 40 to 60 milliseconds );they can wriggle;which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms;and they coil round prey
powered by contraction of the striated muscle
but of a highly specialized type
to their inactive state;but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle
that run from near the mouth to the opposite end , and are spaced evenly round the body
rather like that of a Mexican wave
From each balancer;in the statocyst;and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows , and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows
via water disturbances;created by the cilia
which are muscular , cuplike extensions;of the body;that project;beyond the mouth
running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes;( rather than trailing far behind , as in the Cydippida )
Between the lobes;on either side of the mouth;many;that produce water currents;that help direct microscopic prey;toward the mouth

to the lobes;in species;with ( four ) auricles;the cilia;edging the auricles;are extensions;of cilia;in four of the comb rows
when moving through the water , using the cilia on their comb rows;for propulsion;although Leucothea has long and active auricles;whose movements also contribute to propulsion
by clapping their lobes;so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly
Unlike cydippids;rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs;on the same row;beat;in the same Mexican wave style;as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids
that are less egg-like
also known as Nuda;but their large pharynx;just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body;bears " macrocilia " at the oral end
that are too large to swallow whole almost always other ctenophores
on the stomach wall;that " zip " the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections;with the opposite adhesive strip
when it is pursuing prey
( " belt animals " );aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon
of comb-rows along each aboral edge;emerging from a groove all along the oral edge;which stream back across most of the wing-like body surface
as well as by the beating of their comb-rows
in warm , and warm-temperate waters :;( " Venus ' girdle " );up to 1.5 meters ( 4.9 ft ) long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly
which is typically less than 20 centimeters ( 0.66 ft ) long
that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction;with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles;on the aboral surface
by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular " foot "

algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore;into the current
except that in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives
and eggs and sperm are released;via pores;in the epidermis
but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch

in other words;form;and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults
In the genus Beroe the juveniles;like the adults
In most species
In some groups;such as the flat , bottom-dwelling platyctenids;as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis;after dropping to the sea-floor
When some species , including Bathyctena chuni , Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera , are disturbed;( ink );that luminesce at much the same wavelengths;as their bodies
to their body size;than adults , whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies
nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals;environments;such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters
there are no vegetarians and only one genus;that is partly parasitic
If food is plentiful
While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores;surface-water;( planktonic animals ) ranging in size from the microscopic , including mollusc and fish larvae;to small adult crustaceans;such as copepods , amphipods , and even krill
( stinging cells );instead of colloblasts
in their wide range of techniques;from capturing prey;some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as " webs " , some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders , and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread;as bolas spiders do
with rather few species
close relatives of sea-squirts;that form large chain-like floating colonies;and juveniles of Lampea;attach themselves like parasites;to salps;that are too large for them to swallow
cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time;because they specialize in different types of prey :;such as adult copepods;while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers;such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae
because it was thought their low ratio;of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet;for other animals
although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue
Oncorhynchus keta;if there are enough of them around
mainly
and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations
ctenophores and jellyfish often;in population;and may have a greater effect;on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters
during blooms;in the Red Sea
as are the larvae;of some flatworms;that parasitize fish;when they reach adulthood
On the other hand;in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore;via the ballast tanks of ships;and has been blamed for causing sharp drops;in fish catches;by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans;that would otherwise feed the adult fish
( although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea );as it can breed very rapidly
and above all by the absence of efficient predators;on these introduced ctenophores
in those areas;by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American;ctenophore Beroe ovata;and by a cooling of the local climate;from 1991 to 1993;which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism
However;in the area

Starting in the late 1950s , American computer scientist;with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant , efficient routing method;for telecommunication messages;as part of a research program;at the RAND Corporation;funded by the US Department of Defense
largely fortified by the development of telecommunications;in the Bell System
until the independent work of Donald Davies;at the National Physical Laboratory ( United Kingdom );( NPL );in the late 1960s
in Europe;in the decade following , including the incorporation;of the concept;in the early ARPANET;in the United States
a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session , each having a constant bit rate and latency;between nodes
In cases of billable services;such as cellular communication services;even when no data is transferred;while packet switching may be characterized by a fee;per unit of information transmitted;such as characters , packets , or messages
or without intermediate forwarding nodes;( packet switches or routers )
asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline;for fair queuing , traffic shaping;or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service;such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket
In case of a shared physical medium;( such as radio or 10BASE5 )
during his research;at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks , first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265 , later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962;and finally in report RM 3420;in 1964
distributed , survivable communications network
use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks , later called packets , and delivery;of these messages;by store and forward;switching
Starting in 1965;at the National Physical Laboratory , UK;independently;as developed by Baran
a more accessible name than Baran 's , and proposed to build a nationwide network;in the UK
after which a person from the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) told him about Baran 's work
( Roger Scantlebury );on Operating System Principles;and suggested it for use
In connectionless mode
sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery
source address , and port numbers

for a dedicated path;to help the packet find its way;to its destination;which is therefore larger;and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory
Each packet is dispatched and may go;via different routes;for every packet;as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up;but with less information;as to the application 's requirements
At the destination;based on the packet sequence number
Thus;also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user;by a transport layer protocol;although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service
before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication
rather than address information;so that they are delivered;in order;and with error checking
during the connection set-up phase;when the route to the destination is discovered;and an entry is added to the switching table;in each network node through which the connection passes

for service parameters
in a table
as it only needs to contain this code and any information;such as length , timestamp , or sequence number;which is different for different packets


the data link layer
before any user packets are transmitted

inside the packet network
( UNI )
it wishes inside the network
and its link layer protocol ( LAPB ) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures
of ISDN 's layer two protocol , LAPD and LAPB
As such;not end-to-end

which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model
to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks
as well , but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient

However;( the Data Link Connection ID , or DLCI );with a minimum set of procedures
Thus;of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances;beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol

Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol;like X.25
For X.25


by virtue of having no network layer procedures;by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode;( SABM )
but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic;to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake
For a while
However;( IP ) at the network layer , and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) and or versions;of Multi-Protocol Label Switching ( MPLS ) at layer two


Before the introduction of X.25;in 1973

In the virtual call system;to the host
with less functionality than in the datagram model

developed by Apple Inc. in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers
used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 90s
that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement;for a centralized router or server
automatically;updated the distributed namespace , and configured any required inter-network routing

designed and directed by Louis Pouzin
First demonstrated in 1973;and to support network research generally
rather than the network itself;using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms

created by Digital Equipment Corporation;originally released in 1975;in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers
in the 1980s
Initially built with three layers;( 1982 )

However;( and later );and several implementations were developed outside DEC , including one;for Linux
In 1965;at the instigation of Warner Sinback;based on this voice-phone network;( Schenectady , Phoenix , Chicago , and Phoenix );apparently the world 's first commercial online service

In October 1972;at Michigan State University;in East Lansing
Over the next several years;in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal;to host connections;( remote job submission , remote printing , batch file transfer );to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks;to X.25 data networks;in Michigan
starting in the mid-1980s

as a means of making ARPANET technology public

Interesting note :


such as DATAPAC and
such as TELENET and TYMNET
which was a joint venture;of Bell Canada ( a common carrier ) and Northern Telecom;( a telecommunications equipment supplier )

13th century;in farming and trading

In the 1330s;starting in 1331 , with a deadly plague;arriving soon after
that may have included plague;during the 15 years;before it reached Constantinople in 1347
via Genoese traders;at the port city of Kaffa;in the Crimea;in 1347
After a protracted siege;during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease;to infect the inhabitants
whence it spread north
Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate
From Italy;striking France , Spain , Portugal and England by June 1348 , then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia;from 1348 to 1350
in 1349;when a ship landed at Askøy , then spread to Bjørgvin ( modern Bergen ) and Iceland
Finally;in 1351
that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours;including the Kingdom of Poland , the majority of the Basque Country , isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands , and isolated alpine villages;throughout the continent
during the pandemic;leading to serious depopulation and permanent change;in both economic and social structures
As it spread to western Europe;also
By autumn 1347;probably through the port 's trade;with Constantinople , and ports;on the Black Sea
During 1347;and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon , Syria and Palestine , including Ashkelon , Acre , Jerusalem , Sidon , Damascus , Homs , and Aleppo
In 1348–49

( 1908 );( Black Death );: Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant
Commonly;and from its effects
and then Germany , gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic;as a proper name
In England
during the Middle Ages
most authoritative;at the time;in a report;in 1345;that caused a " great pestilence in the air "
that sought to give advice to sufferers


and only the recurrence;of outbreaks;during the Middle Ages;gave it the name;that has become the medical term
dominant;which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis , also responsible;for an epidemic;that began in southern China in 1865 , eventually spreading to India
who visited Hong Kong in 1894;among whom;was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin;after whom;the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis
by Paul-Louis Simond;and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days;after feeding on an infected host
which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation , resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site , infecting the host
one resistant to the disease;which act as hosts , keeping the disease endemic;and a second that lack resistance
When the second population dies;including people , thus creating a human epidemic
in 1893
for the Black Death;for the second edition;in 1908;implicating rats and fleas in the process;and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics;such as the Justinian plague;that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire;from 541 to 700 CE

( 100–106 °F );headaches , painful aching joints , nausea and vomiting , and a general feeling;of malaise
Left untreated , of those that contract the bubonic plague
to 95 percent

As the disease progresses
with a mortality rate;near 100 %
and purple skin patches;( purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation )
In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague;that were noted as buboes
( genetic branches );associated with medieval mass graves
( which are thought to be extinct );to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis;strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis , suggesting
indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille;around November 1347;and spread through France;over the next two years;eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349;where it spread through the country;in three epidemics
responsible;for the pandemic;that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France , implying Bergen op Zoom ( and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands ) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague , different from those in Britain and France , may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway , the Hanseatic cities or another site
since;and amended
Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England , Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 " that;that may no longer exist;"
published in Nature in October 2011;and indicated that the strain;that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease
but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics;from this period
and even estimates;of overall population;at the start;vary by over 100 %;as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377
from the clergy
( and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague );that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance;and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples;from other mass graves
centuries;temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe;for the survival of fleas;that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague;that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high;that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the Black Death indiscriminately;and that the pattern of the Black Death;with major outbreaks;in the same areas;separated by 5 to 15 years;differs from modern bubonic plague;which often becomes endemic for decades;with annual flare-ups
to the Y. pestis;forward
and Norman Cantor ( 2001 ) thought it may have been a combination;of anthrax and other pandemics
that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar;to Ebola
he;argues that transmission must have been person to person

Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as
In addition to the bubonic infection;( a type of " blood poisoning " );( an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body );which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms
In 2014;with Public Health England;as well as of wills;registered in London;during the period;which supported the pneumonic hypothesis
most widely accepted;Iran and Syria;during this time


in 1338;down to 50 thousand;in 1351
and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well
Interestingly;being created in response;in Central London;evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time
Before 1350;and this was reduced by nearly 40,000;by 1450
In 1348;so;that before any physicians or government authorities had time;to reflect upon its origins
In crowded cities
and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion
since they cared for victims of the Black Death

Over the next few hundred years;1369 , 1379–83 , 1389–93;and throughout the first half of the 15th century

Between 1701 and 1750;and an additional thirty-one;between 1751 and 1800

igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic
which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock , and magma
When a rock crystallizes from melt;( magma and/or lava )
and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock , or be turned into a metamorphic rock;due to heat and pressure;that change the mineral content of the rock;which gives it a characteristic fabric
due to heat and pressure;eroded , deposited , and lithified , ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock
and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism
All three types of rocks may be re-melted;when this happens
In the 1960s;a series of discoveries;the most important of which was seafloor spreading;which includes the crust and rigid uppermost;portion of the upper mantle;that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle;which is called the asthenosphere
the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection;of the mantle :;because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer;of the convecting mantle
between rigid plates;moving on the surface of the Earth and
for many observations of the solid Earth

high regions on the seafloor;where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist
where one plate subducts under another
such as the San Andreas fault system
for Alfred Wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth;over geologic time
also;and a new setting;for the observations of structural geology

in reverse
Early;in this field;( where shear waves were not able to propagate )
with a crust and lithosphere;on top , the mantle below ( separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers );and the outer core and inner core below that
More recently;inside the earth;in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan
and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model

from the formation of the Earth to the present
with an expanded scale
so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale
Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs
of their preceding timeline;as indicated by asterisks

through which they cut
accordingly;if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it;then the formations;that were cut are older than the fault;and the ones;that are not cut;must be younger than the fault
in these situations
if inclusions ( or clasts ) are found in a formation;that contains them
For example;from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer
with igneous rocks
and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix
As a result;which contains them

As organisms exist at the same time period;throughout the world;( sometimes );in which they are found
Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution
however , given the uncertainties;of fossilization;the localization of fossil types;due to lateral changes;in habitat;( facies change in sedimentary strata );and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time
At the beginning of the 20th century

Previously;relative;to one another
With isotopic dates;and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages
that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature;the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice



for sedimentary rock units;which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques

the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography
When rock units are placed under horizontal compression
through faulting and folding
In the shallow crust;where brittle deformation can occur;which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock
as noted by the principle of superposition
along faults;either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along , forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault
Deeper in the Earth;and fold instead of faulting
in the center of the fold buckles;upwards;creating " antiforms ";or
If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards;respectively
If some of the units in the fold are facing downward;and if all of the rock units;are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown , they are simply called by the most general terms , antiforms and synforms
as a whole;and thinner
and through the ductile stretching and thinning
that are higher below those that are lower
placed below older units
thinning;in fact , there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter
at the depth;to be ductilely stretched
known as boudins;after the French word for " sausage " , because of their visual similarity
both depositionally and intrusively , often
on the rock unit;that is increasing in elevation;to be eroded by hillslopes and channels
that is going down
Continual;along the fault;and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit

and igneous intrusions enter from below
long , planar igneous intrusions;and therefore often form in large numbers;in areas;that are being actively deformed
such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield , or rings;of dikes;around the lava tube of a volcano
and do not necessarily occur in a single order
for example;almost
in the southwestern United States;that have remained in place since Cambrian time

In the southwestern United States;volcanic , and intrusive;faulted , foliated , and folded
such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton;in northwestern Canada , the oldest known rock;in the world;where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis
In addition
In many places;the Grand Canyon;in the southwestern United States;being a very visible example;and then deformation ended and the upper , undeformed units were deposited
Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur , and they can occur any number of times
laboratory , and numerical modeling methods;that occur on and inside the Earth
In typical geological investigations;( the study of rocks );stratigraphy ( the study of sedimentary layers );and structural geology ( the study of positions of rock units and their deformation )
In many cases;investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways , and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface
In addition to identifying rocks in the field
for identifying rocks in the laboratory
In an optical mineralogy analysis;where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties;with a conoscopic lens
In the electron microprobe;in composition;within individual crystals

and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear;and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes
metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks
such as subduction and magma chamber evolution
which gives information about strain;within the crystalline structure of the rocks
also;in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area
In addition;in large and small settings
those involving orogenic wedges , which are
In the analog versions of these experiments;which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered ( all angles remain the same ) orogenic wedge
though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift;in the mountain belt
between erosion and the shape of the mountain range
through pressure , temperature , space , and time
In the laboratory;that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores
also;that show the locations of stratigraphic units;in the subsurface
and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions
occurring on the surface of the Earth;interpret past environments , and locate areas;for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction
In the laboratory;cores for the fossils;found in them
in which the rock units formed
within the stratigraphic section;in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition
in igneous rock units;within the drill cores
to gain information;about past climate

To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth

During the mass high school education movement;from 1910–1940;which led to a decrease;in the price of skilled labor
during the period
In fact;which is regarded as a stepping-stone;to acquire college and advanced degrees
and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers
however educational inequality in gender also influence;towards the economy
and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap
and so may be associated with lower economic growth;which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries
( 2006 );to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation;along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality
In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies;in comparison;to continental European liberalism;where unions have remained strong;including high levels of income inequality , high relative and absolute poverty rates , poor and unequal educational outcomes , poor health outcomes , and high rates of crime and incarceration

and globalization;which were also experienced by other industrialized nations;that did n't experience steep;surges;in inequality
He points out that nations with high rates of unionization;particularly in Scandinavia;have very low levels of inequality , and concludes the historical pattern is clear;the cross-national pattern is clear :
to a domestic scale
in the rich countries;while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages

and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable
shared by other experts
in the data;that international trade is increasing income inequality
regarding the effects of international trade;on the distribution of incomes


In many countries;in the labor market

On average;when looking for work;and may be less willing to travel or relocate

Among comments;in academic literature
the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number
as a summer home;than it would to a homeless family of five;reduced " distributive efficiency " within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth;and thus the sum total;of personal utility
spent by a poor person;providing a great deal of utility to that person;such as basic necessities;like food , water , and healthcare;while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items;providing relatively less utility to that person
( " the additional dollar " )
From this standpoint;for any given amount of wealth;in society
for this theory;noting that in societies;where inequality is lower
because consumption;rather than income;should be the measure;of inequality;and inequality;of consumption;is less extreme than inequality of income;in the US

According to Johnson , Smeeding , and Tory;than it was in 1986

less dramatic than household income inequality;by high-income households;as it does their income;though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution;than household income

A number of researchers;( David Rodda , Jacob Vigdor , and Janna Matlack );at least in the US –;is caused in part;by income inequality
( Rhoda 1994 : 148 )
Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods;for example;in East New York;as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units
combined with rising prices

If the state does not provide these services;for those on lower incomes;who are worse
Secondly;enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration;is by taking on debt

smaller;resulting in many cases;in more environmental degradation
that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy , it increases their yearly carbon emissions
( EKC )
should;however that in certain cases;with great economic inequality;and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards;( water treatment , filtering , ... ) ...

If there were fewer people however;and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well
As such;as well
If ( as WWF argued );population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level;( 1/3 of current levels , so about 2 billion people );while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage
by a class of owners;creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives;off unearned property income;by virtue of ownership titles;in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock
By contrast;in the form of a wage or salary
In order to rectify this situation
( usually in the form of taxation )
However;and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves
when they improve society as a whole , including the poorest members

Some see Rawls 's argument;as a justification;for capitalism;since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations;under capitalism;others believe
looks at income inequality and poverty;as form of " capability deprivation "
Unlike neoliberalism;which " defines well-being as utility maximization "
[ en ];through increasing functionings;( the things a person values doing );capabilities ( the freedom to enjoy functionings ) and agency;( the ability to pursue valued goals )
When a person 's capabilities are lowered;as they would otherwise

Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today 's North China for decades
and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia and Korea
after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty
while others only used their native language ( i.e. Mongolian ) and the ' Phags-pa ' script
and an imperial Chinese
ruled by the successors of Möngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire
In official Chinese histories;following the Song dynasty and preceding the Ming dynasty
yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records;as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu
In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name;( 《建國號詔》 );and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties;from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty
In 1271;( Chinese : 大元 ; pinyin : Dà Yuán ; Wade–Giles : Ta-Yüan );establishing the Yuan dynasty
( 大元 );( dà zai Qián Yuán / " Great is Qián , the Primal " ) in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes ( I Ching ) section regarding Qián;( 乾 )
also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus
( Great Yuan );with the " Yeke Mongghul Ulus ";( lit. " Great Mongol State " );resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus;( Mongolian script : );meaning " Great Yuan Great Mongol State "
similar to the names " Manchu dynasty " or " Manchu Dynasty of China ";for the Qing dynasty
Furthermore;since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan
Nevertheless;directly ruled by Great Khans;before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty;by Kublai Khan;in 1271

and his successors;across Asia
Under the reign of Genghis ' third son , Ögedei Khan;conquering most of northern China
in Xingzhou , Hebei
but had several Han Chinese teachers attached to him since his early years;by his mother Sorghaghtani

in 1251
held territories in China
issued paper money , revived Chinese rituals , and endorsed policies;that stimulated agricultural and commercial growth
later renamed Shangdu
to fight against the Jin

and Shi Tianze
against Western Xia;for the Mongols
with each Tumen consisting of 10,000 troops

and a Korean woman;and his son Shi Gang was born to one of his Jurchen wives
the surname of his Korean wife was Li;and the surname of his Han Chinese wife was Shi
upon their invasion of the Jin dynasty
the Kerait were Mongolified Turkic people and were considered;part of the " Mongol nation "
( Shih T ' ien-tse );Zhang Rou ( Chang Jou , 張柔 );and Yan Shi ( Yen Shih , 嚴實 ) and other high ranking Chinese;who served in the Jin dynasty and defected to the Mongols
( Tsagaan );jointly;ordered by Töregene Khatun
in southern China
that invaded southern China
without a successor
when he learned that his brother , Ariq Böke , was challenging his claim;to the throne
that elected him Great Khan

to ensure
among his subjects
and surrendered in 1264
( Golden Horde , Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate );although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai;as Great Khan


and threatened the western frontier of Kublai 's domain
hostile but weakened
by installing the hostage prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea;making it a Mongol tributary state

the son-in-law of a powerful official;in 1262
After successfully suppressing the revolt;in his court

after 1262;and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects
by centralizing the bureaucracy;expanding the circulation of paper money , and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron
and left the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties unchanged
However;later four , classes with the Han Chinese;occupying the lowest rank
but their official rank was nebulous

such as the Venetian merchant Marco Polo;who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China
like Christopher Columbus;in search of its legendary wealth
During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius;at Qufu;to Quzhou;while the newly established Jin dynasty ( 1115–1234 ) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou 's brother Kong Duancao;who remained in Qufu;as Duke Yansheng
From that time up;until the Yuan dynasty;once in the north in Qufu and the other;in the south;at Quzhou
During the Yuan dynasty

which ruled Annam;( Dai Viet );( 1288 )
( Chen );before they migrated under Trần Kinh ( 陳京 , Chén Jīng ) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Trần dynasty which ruled Vietnam Đại Việt;and certain members;of the clan;could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting;with the Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn;( later King Trần Hưng Đạo );in 1282
like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao;after the Mongol invasion of the Song;and they helped the Tran fight;against the Mongol invasion
as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao;who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as " Northern bandits "
with the Yuan dynasty
Following the conquest of Dali;in 1253;ruling;recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan , Ming , and Qing-era governments;principally in the province of Yunnan
however;later causing much strife and internal struggle

but he died;before Kublai;in 1285
Thus;with the support of his mother Kökejin and the minister Bayan;and ruled as Temür Khan , or Emperor Chengzong;from 1294 to 1307
begun by his grandfather
also;which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades
However;during the reign of Temür Khan
fourth;Buyantu Khan ( Ayurbarwada )
after the reign of Kublai;to the discontent of some Mongol elite
a Confucian academic
including the liquidation of the Department of State Affairs;( Chinese : 尚書省 );which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials
Starting in 1313;testing their knowledge on significant historical works
Also;as well as publishing;or translating a number of Chinese books and works
Ayurbarwada 's son and successor;from 1321 to 1323
based on the Confucian principles;with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor Baiju
During his reign;( Chinese : 大元通制 , " the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan " );a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan dynasty;begun by his father
from a rival faction;perhaps steppe elite opposed to Confucian reforms
( or Taidingdi );and , after an unsuccessful attempt;to calm the princes
When Yesün Temür died in Shangdu;in 1328;by the Qipchaq commander El Temür
( Emperor Wenzong );while Yesün Temür 's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne;in Shangdu;with the support of Yesün Temür 's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah
from princes and officers;in Northern China;known as the War of the Two Capitals
Afterwards;who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey;and announced Khanbaliq 's intent;to welcome him
However;with Tugh Temür
by El Temür;and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne
such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate;to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world
However;during his latter three-year reign
and brought power to warlords , whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty
Due to the fact;that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür;instead
honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values
most;( Chinese : 奎章閣學士院 );first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake " a number of tasks;relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment;"
but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium;named Jingshi Dadian ( Chinese : 經世大典 )

( Emperor Ningzong );( Emperor Huizong );and succeeded to the throne
After El Temür 's death;as El Temür had been in the beginning of his long reign
As Toghun Temür grew
In 1340;who was in discord;with Bayan
With the dismissal of Bayan

in central government
Jin , and Song dynasties;which were eventually completed in 1345
Yet;and he was not called back until 1349
famine , and bitterness;among the populace
In time;across Asia;while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese
Gradually;as well
and marked by intrigues and rivalries
and China was torn by dissension and unrest
from the weakening Yuan armies
From the late 1340s onwards;in the countryside;such as droughts , floods and the resulting famines;and the government 's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support
In 1351;and grew into a nationwide uprising
In 1354;when Toghtogha led a large army to crush the Red Turban rebels
on the one hand;and a rapid weakening;of the central government;on the other
but to rely on local warlords ' military power;and gradually lost his interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles
( present-day Beijing );in 1368;after the approach of the forces of the Míng dynasty;( 1368–1644 );founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in the south
He had tried to regain Khanbaliq;which eventually failed;( located in present-day Inner Mongolia ) two years later;( 1370 )
shortly after his death

developed;during the Yuan dynasty
and the increased use;of the written vernacular
between East and West
extensive;and European
other;and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much
until its decline;the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia , the Ilkhanate , encouraged this development
in the Yuan government;during this period
astronomy , medicine , clothing , and diet in East Asia
such as carrots , turnips , new varieties of lemons , eggplants , and melons , high-quality granulated sugar , and cotton;during the Yuan dynasty

From this period;by Muslims of Central Asia;in the northwest and southwest

( especially Tibetan Buddhism );although Taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism;from the Yuan government
and examinations based on the Classics;which had fallen into disuse in north China during the period of disunity , were reinstated by the Yuan court;probably in the hope of maintaining order;over Han society
cartography , geography , and scientific education
from this time
whose account of his trip to " Cambaluc , " the capital of the Great Khan , and of life there astounded the people of Europe
( or , The Million , known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo )
tea houses , which would have been a prominent sight;since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture , as well the practice;of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan
since many of the places he named;were in Persian

who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year;which was only 26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar 's measurement
and improved
To provide against possible famines
that included artificial lakes , hills and mountains , and parks
During the Yuan period;which was completely renovated
commercially oriented;throughout Asia;and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe
to the West;as hydraulic engineering
also;sorghum , along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation
that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China
In the historiography of Mongolia
and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan;is considered to be " the beginning of an infinite number of beings , the foundation;of peace and happiness;state power;the dream of many peoples;besides it there is nothing great or precious;"
In traditional historiography of China;on the other hand;between the Song dynasty and the Ming dynasty
Note , however;before Kublai Khan 's formal establishment of the Yuan;in 1271 , partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu;( Chinese : 太祖 )
Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views;( including the government of the Ming dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty );also;[ who ? ];but rather as a period of foreign domination

including that of the Han Chinese , Khitans , Jurchens , Mongols , and Tibetan Buddhists
that of native Chinese dynasties , the Yuan bureaucracy actually;consisted of a mix of elements;from different cultures

such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu;and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai 's reign
among civil , military , and censorial offices;including the Central Secretariat;( Zhongshu Sheng );to manage civil affairs;the Privy Council ( Chinese : 樞密院 ) to manage military affairs;and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection
however;due to the Mongol traditional reliance;on military institutions and offices;as the core of governance
Nevertheless , such;with the Central Secretariat;as the top institution;that was ( directly or indirectly ) responsible for most other governmental agencies;( such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries )
At various times;( Shangshu Sheng );that mainly dealt with finance;( such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong );but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards
While the existence of these central government departments and the Six Ministries ( which had been introduced since the Sui and Tang dynasties ) gave a Sinicized image in the Yuan administration;also
For example;who had separate courts of justice
involving members of more than one ethnic;consisting of Chinese and Mongols
as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council
Since its invention in 1269;a unified script for spelling Mongolian , Tibetan , and Chinese languages;until the end of the dynasty
but they could generally converse well in the language
and the Ikeres;whose mother was a Tangut concubine

an example is Tugh Temur;( Emperor Wenzong );who wrote poetry , painted , read Chinese classical texts , and ordered the compilation of books
with income;from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty
and by 1290;in all parts of the Mongol Empire commoners;were selling their children into slavery
Seeing this as damaging to the Mongol nation;in 1291
that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his Mongolian credentials with his own people
built a capital within China , supported Chinese religions and culture , and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court
But;at the same time
In the China of the Yuan , or Mongol era;various important;in the arts;including the areas of painting , mathematics , calligraphy , poetry , and theater;with many great artists and writers being famous today
Due to the coming together of painting , poetry , and calligraphy at this time;though perhaps more famed;for one area of their achievements than others
Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting , poetry , and calligraphy
In the area of Chinese painting;during the Yuan dynasty
In the area of calligraphy
which was used among other poetic forms;by most of the famous Yuan poets
during this time;and the other way around , with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu
in the mix of the zaju variety show
during the Yuan era;of poetry;painting , and calligraphy;into a unified piece of the type
into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show
which have often been better preserved in places;such as the Shōsōin;in Japan
such as Buddhism , Islam , and Christianity
in China
However;unlike the western khanates
Instead;the founder of the Yuan dynasty;especially the Tibetan variants
As a result
known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs;( Xuanzheng Yuan );( modern Beijing );to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire
Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism
and his successors;( Dishi )
Before the end of the Yuan dynasty;thereby enjoying special power

almost all from Tibetan originals
such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors;also;and institutions

during the Yuan era
( 1249–1314 );using a rectangular array of coefficients;equivalent to modern matrices
with only one unknown
written in 1303



in China

the Shoushi Li ( 授時暦 ) or Calendar;for Fixing the Seasons;as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty
or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers
in the Shoushi calendar;in Muslim calendars
from the Middle East;under the Mongols;and Muslim astronomers brought Arabic numerals to China;in the 13th century

called otachi and traditional Mongol shamans
which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of Mongol shamanism
from the Yuan government;and were given special legal privileges
to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors
because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with Confucian virtues
that the Yuan inherited from the Jin dynasty
but advocated different theoretical approaches;toward medicine
Under the Mongols
as they expanded towards the west
such as acupuncture , moxibustion , pulse diagnosis , and various herbal drugs and elixirs

( 1277–1347 );which he performed using anesthetics
in a 1330 medical treatise
by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court;where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or Muslim medicine
in 1263;during the reign of Kublai

because its humoral system contradicted the yin-yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine


through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries
such as Wang Zhen 's Nong Shu;a technology invented in the 12th century

inscribed with the name of Töregene Khatun;sponsored by the Mongols
In 1273;a government-sponsored printing office
for printing throughout China
and government agencies
the paper money of the Yuan

but switched to bronze plates;in 1275

where he explained Yuan paper money to the Il-khanate court of Gaykhatu
but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment
Politically;between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system
Nevertheless , socially;that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties
Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power;( various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire );and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong " colonial " coloration
due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule
in the dynasty;and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination;in the early 14th century
In general;Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility
also;that existed;during the Yuan dynasty
In response;to an objection;against the use of " barbarians ";in his government;during the Yuan dynasty;who employed only " Mongols and Tartars " and discarded northern and southern Chinese;and this was precisely the cause;that brought disaster upon them
At the same time;in China;the Mongols;to serve as administrators;over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia , using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands
like Besh Baliq , Almaliq , and Samarqand;by the Mongols;where they worked as artisans and farmers
with one unit called " Right Alan Guard ";which was combined with " recently surrendered " soldiers , Mongols , and Chinese soldiers;stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh;the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi;( Ch ' i Kung-chih )
After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia;by Genghis Khan;with Chinese and Qara-Khitays ( Khitans ) of gardens and fields;in Samarqand;was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them
( Khitan );familiar with Chinese culture his name was Ahai
Despite the high position;given to Muslims;restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision , as well as Kosher butchering for Jews , forcing them to eat food the Mongol way
Toward the end
like Lan Yu;who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat
which meant " barracks " and could also mean " thanks "
and it was given in thanks;by the Han Chinese;for assisting them
During the war fighting the Mongols;among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang
in the Ispah Rebellion;but the rebellion was crushed;and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding
since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese;while there were less rich;Mongol and Semu;than there were Mongol and Semu;who lived in poverty and were ill treated
for the order of the classes;why people were placed in a certain class;they surrendered to the Mongols , and had nothing;to do with their ethnicity
the higher they were placed , the more the held out , the lower they
and Southern Chinese were ranked lower;because southern China withstood and fought to the last;before caving in
during this era;for private southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants
When the Mongols placed the Uighurs of the Kingdom of Qocho;over the Koreans at the court the Korean King objected;then;saying that the Uighur King of Qocho was ranked higher than the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler , who in turn was ranked higher than the Korean King , who was ranked last , because the Uighurs surrendered to the Mongols first , the Karluks surrendered after the Uighurs , and the Koreans surrendered last , and that the Uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting
consisting of present-day Hebei;to the north of the Yellow River;( or Zhongshu Sheng );( modern Beijing );similarly , another top-level administrative department called the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs ( or Xuanzheng Yuan ) held administrative rule over the whole of modern-day Tibet;and a part of Sichuan , Qinghai and Kashmir
within an organism;that protects against disease
To function properly;known as pathogens;and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue
In many species;such as the innate immune system;versus the adaptive immune system , or humoral immunity;versus cell-mediated immunity
In humans;and similar fluid–brain barriers;which protects the brain

when;resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections
In humans;such as severe combined immunodeficiency;such as HIV/AIDS , or the use of immunosuppressive medication
In contrast
rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 , and systemic lupus erythematosus

that examines the structure and function of the immune system
on the causes of immunity to disease
earliest known;in 430 BC

In the 18th century
in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease
such as the miasma theory
for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905;that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease
in 1901;with the discovery of the yellow fever virus;by Walter Reed
with layered defenses of increasing specificity
In simple terms;such as bacteria and viruses;from entering the organism
If a pathogen breaches these barriers

If pathogens successfully evade the innate response;which is activated by the innate response
Here;during an infection;to improve its recognition of the pathogen
after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory;and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered
to distinguish between self and non-self molecules
In immunology;that can be distinguished from foreign substances;by the immune system
recognized as foreign molecules
( short for antibody generators ) and are defined as substances;that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response
that successfully enter an organism
when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors , which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms , or when damaged , injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals , many of which ( but not all ) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens
meaning these systems respond to pathogens;in a generic way
against a pathogen
in most organisms
including mechanical , chemical , and biological barriers
the exoskeleton of insects , the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs , and skin
However;as organisms can not be completely sealed from their environments;such as the lungs , intestines , and the genitourinary tract
In the lungs;and other irritants from the respiratory tract
also;while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms

such as the β-defensins
such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2;in saliva , tears , and breast milk
while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens
In the stomach
Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts;for food and space;and;in some cases , by changing the conditions;in their environment;such as pH or available iron
that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness
However;since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi;such as a vaginal candidiasis;( a yeast infection )
that re-introduction of probiotic flora;such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli;normally found in unpasteurized yogurt , helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis , inflammatory bowel diseases , urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections
to infection
which are caused by increased blood flow;into tissue
which are released by injured or infected cells
that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation , and leukotrienes;that attract certain white blood cells;( leukocytes )
chemokines;that promote chemotaxis;and interferons;that have anti-viral effects;such as shutting down protein synthesis;in the host cell

These;other;and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal;of pathogens
performed by cells;called ' phagocytes ' that engulf;or eat , pathogens or particles
generally;but can be called to specific locations;by cytokines
Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte;which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome
or following a respiratory burst;that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome
but this role was extended in phagocytes;to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism
as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals
that travel throughout the body;in pursuit of invading pathogens
and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes
During the acute phase of inflammation;particularly as a result of bacterial infection;in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells;to arrive at the scene of infection
that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors;such as interleukin 1
ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris , and as antigen-presenting cells;that activate the adaptive immune system
( white blood cells )
( macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells );mast cells , eosinophils , basophils , and natural killer cells
or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms

( DC );that are in contact;with the external environment;therefore , they are located mainly in the skin , nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines
to neuronal dendrites;as both have many spine-like projections;connected to the nervous system
as they present antigens to T cells;one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system
or NK cells;which does not directly attack invading microbes
Rather;such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells;recognizing such cells by a condition;known as " missing self;"
( major histocompatibility complex );a situation;that can arise in viral infections of host cells
because of the initial notion;that they do not require activation;in order to kill cells;that are " missing self;"
For many years
and the NK cells become activated through recognition of " missing self "
because they express intact self MHC antigens
( KIR );which essentially put the brakes on NK cells
adaptive;and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory;where each pathogen is " remembered " by a signature antigen
and requires the recognition of specific " non-self " antigens;during a process;called antigen presentation
that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells
to mount these tailored;by " memory cells "
Should a pathogen infect the body more than once;specific
that recognize specific targets
such as a pathogen;only after antigens ( small fragments of the pathogen ) have been processed and presented in combination with a " self " receptor;called a major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecule
the killer T cell and the helper T cell
In addition
only;while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens;coupled to Class II MHC molecules

that recognize intact antigens;that are not bound to MHC receptors
that kill cells;that are infected with viruses;( and other pathogens );or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional
As with B cells
( TCR );in a complex;with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell
this MHC :;called CD8
where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen
When;activated;such cells;such as perforin;which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter
( a protease )

and generally;a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by " helper " T cells;( see below )
( TCR );that recognize antigen;bound to Class II MHC molecules
which recruits molecules;inside the T cell;( e.g. , Lck );that are responsible for the T cell 's activation
antigen complex;than observed for killer T cells , meaning many receptors ( around 200–300 ) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC : antigen;in order to activate the helper cell;while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC : antigen molecule
with an antigen-presenting cell
that influence the activity of many cell types
produced by helper T cells;and the activity of killer T cells
In addition;expressed on the T cell 's surface;such as CD40 ligand;( also called CD154 );which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells
delta;( γδ T cells );( TCR );as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ ( αβ ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells , cytotoxic T cells and NK cells
that produce responses from γδ T
Like other ' unconventional ' T cell subsets;bearing invariant TCRs;such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells
On one hand;as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype
On the other hand;as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors
For example;produced by microbes;and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells;in epithelia;respond to stressed epithelial cells
when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen
and processed by proteolysis;into peptides

which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell
As the activated B cell then begins to divide;( plasma cells );that recognizes this antigen
expressing the antigen;by complement activation;or for uptake and destruction;by phagocytes
or by interfering with the receptors;that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells
When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate
Throughout the lifetime of an animal;and can mount a strong response;if the pathogen is detected again
because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges

to microbes

During pregnancy;directly across the placenta;so;have high levels of antibodies;even at birth;with the same range of antigen specificities;as their mother
also;that are transferred to the gut of the infant;and protect against bacterial infections;until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies
because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies;it only borrows them
lasting from a few days up;to several months
In medicine;also;to another via antibody-rich serum
altering the sensitivity of the immune system
For example
such as;and their onset often coincides with puberty
By contrast;such as testosterone

When suffering from sleep deprivation;and a lower immune response;than would be noted in a well-rested individual
Additionally;which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms;through instances of sleep deprivation;shift work , etc
As a result;such as heart disease , chronic pain , and asthma

Conversely;notably thyroid hormone activity
in the elderly
As people age
First;due to decreased activity levels

Second , as a person ages
to;using killer T cells
in a similar way;to viral antigens

than normal;this is a common phenomenon with tumors
Sometimes;allowing for their destruction by the complement system
Unlike animals;but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals;that are sent through a plant
known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs
When a part of a;becomes infected;whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant
( SAR );used by plants;that renders the entire plant resistant;to a particular infectious agent
as they can block virus replication
particularly the autoimmune disorders
Here;and attacks part of the body
Under normal circumstances
( located in the thymus and bone marrow );produced throughout the body;and to eliminate those cells;that recognize self-antigens , preventing autoimmunity
when;or more
to respond to pathogens;with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence
In developed countries
However;in developing countries
phagocyte function , IgA antibody concentrations , and cytokine production
at an early age;through genetic mutation or surgical removal results;high susceptibility


( also called immunization );in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity;against that particular pathogen;without causing disease;associated with that organism
because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system;as well as its inducibility
With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death;in the human population
to elude host immune responses
Therefore;while evading detection or destruction by the immune system
that digest the barrier;for example;by using a type II secretion system
Alternatively , using a type III secretion system;providing a direct route;for proteins;to move from the pathogen to the host

In the mid-1950s;inspired by a suggestion;made by Niels Jerne;( CST )
On the basis of CST;" self " constituents ( constituents of the body ) do not trigger destructive immune responses;while " nonself " entities ( pathogens , an allograft ) trigger a destructive immune response

but remain very influential

Glucocorticoids are the most;powerful of these drugs;such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis;and their use must be tightly controlled
such as methotrexate or azathioprine
such as activated T cells
However;and other constantly dividing cells and their organs;which causes toxic side effects
such as cyclosporin;to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways
In contrast;such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs;( cytotoxic T lymphocytes );peak in order to elicit an effective response;against any intruding pathogens
As well;active;and catecholamines , peak

First;if it were to occur;during wake times
Second;due to the presence of melatonin
and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production;during this time
When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen
that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D , the steroid hormone calcitriol
with vitamin D
Not only;calcitriol , but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1;which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D;calcidiol into the steroid hormone version;calcitriol
Only after binding to calcitriol
that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol;keratinocytes and macrophages
to identify molecules;associated with pathogens
called defensins;found in all animals and plants;and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity

and are thought to play a role;in the immune response;to viruses

( e.g. , immunoglobulins and T cell receptors )
However;distinct;such as the lamprey and hagfish
( VLRs );that;like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates;are produced from only a small number ( one or two ) of genes
and with the same degree of specificity
as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response
that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity
with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens;called bacteriophages
also;through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage;that they have come into contact with in the past;which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference
but studies of their roles in defense are few
but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude
from the end of the nineteenth century;up to the present time
between " cellular " and " humoral " theories of immunity
by Elie Metchnikoff;more precisely , phagocytes;that were responsible for immune responses
In contrast;held;among others , by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring;( molecules )
Clearly;and go on to become cancers
molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection;by killer T cells
also;for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β;which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes
In addition;so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells
that damages the body 's own tissues
( Type I IV ) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course;of the hypersensitive reaction
often associated with allergy

when cross-linked by antigen
when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction
( or cytotoxic );and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies
( aggregations of antigens , complement proteins , and IgG and IgM antibodies );deposited in various tissues
( also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity );to develop
but may also involve contact dermatitis;( poison ivy )
monocytes , and macrophages
used by several pathogens;( also called intracellular pathogenesis )
Here;where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells , antibodies and complement
that cause malaria ( Plasmodium falciparum ) and leishmaniasis;( Leishmania spp. )
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis;that prevents lysis by complement
that diminish or misdirect the host 's immune response
to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system
e.g. , the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections;characteristic of cystic fibrosis
that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective;examples include Streptococcus;( protein G );Staphylococcus aureus;( protein A );and Peptostreptococcus magnus;( protein L )

( amino acids and/or sugars );on the surface of the pathogen;while keeping essential epitopes concealed

so the proteins;on its viral envelope;that are essential for entry;into its host target cell
directed at this virus
for another;allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response
with host molecules;by the immune system
envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell


that are not found on normal cells
To the immune system;and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells
The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources;like human papillomavirus;which causes cervical cancer;while others are the organism 's own proteins;that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels;in tumor cells
when expressed at high levels;( e.g. melanocytes )
for regulating cell growth and survival;that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules;called oncogenes
( >500 Da );particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly;or in larger doses
based on larger peptides and proteins;( which are typically larger than 6000 Da )
In some cases;but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound , as is sometimes the case for Taxol
which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies , assessing likely virulence of mutations;in viral coat particles , and validation;of proposed peptide-based drug treatments
that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions;than hydrophobic amino acids;however , more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques;using databases of existing known epitopes;usually on well-studied virus proteins;as a training set
publicly accessible;from pathogens;known to be recognizable by B cells

( proteomics );involved in the immune response
In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation;intertwined
First;during the early slow-wave-sleep stage;epinephrine , and norepinephrine;pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin
interleukin-12 , TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma
then;such as immune cells activation , proliferation , and differentiation
during this time;that;like naïve and central memory T cells;peak ( i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response )
In addition to these effects;( leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin );a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance;towards one;that supports Th1 , an increase;in overall Th cell proliferation , and naïve T cell migration;to lymph nodes

Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization;by the immune system;however
Even;such as bacteria;that protect against bacteriophage infections
basic;and remain in their modern descendants;such as plants and invertebrates
antimicrobial;and the complement system
including humans;including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently
( or acquired );after an initial response;to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response;to subsequent encounters;with that same pathogen

In humans;that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins;to carbohydrates;on the surfaces of microbes

that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation;of complement molecules;which are also proteases
After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe;which in turn;activates other complement proteases , and so on
that amplifies the initial signal;by controlled positive feedback
in the production of peptides;that attract immune cells;and opsonize ( coat ) the surface of a pathogen , marking it for destruction

because by definition , any such number n has at least three distinct divisors , namely 1 , 2 , and n


Similarly;when written in the usual decimal system;3 , 7 , or 9 , since even numbers;of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5

but Euclid 's fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( mentioned above ) would not hold as stated
For example;if 1 were admitted as a prime;these two presentations would be considered different factorizations;of 15;into prime numbers;so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified
Similarly;if 1 were considered a prime : a modified version;of the sieve;that considers 1;as prime;would eliminate all multiples of 1 ( that is , all other numbers ) and produce as output only the single number 1
Furthermore;such as the relationship of the number;to its corresponding value of Euler 's totient function or the sum of divisors function

If we repeat the test n times and pass every time;then;that our number is composite;which decreases exponentially with the number of tests;so we can be as sure as we like ( though never perfectly sure );that the number is prime

A flaw with this test is that;( the Carmichael numbers );so the test;of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers

into the lake
and at first;does n't mix with the warmer , green waters of Upper Lake
But then , at the so-called Rheinbrech;because of the greater density;of cold water
at the northern ( German ) shore of the lake;off the island of Lindau
then;until Hagnau am Bodensee
into Lake Überlingen
into the Rheinrinne ( " Rhine Gutter " ) and Seerhein
Depending on the water level;is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake
flows generally westward , as the Hochrhein , passes the Rhine Falls , and is joined by its major tributary , the river Aare
more;to an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s;( 35,000 cu ft/s );and provides more than a fifth of the discharge;at the Dutch border
from the 4,274 m ( 14,022 ft ) summit of Finsteraarhorn , the highest point of the Rhine basin
with the exceptions of the canton of Schaffhausen and parts of the cantons of Zürich and Basel-Stadt;until it turns north at the so-called Rhine knee at Basel , leaving Switzerland
In the centre of Basel;in the course of the stream;this is a major bend;where the overall direction of the Rhine changes from West;to North


through the Upper Rhine Plain;which is about 300 km long and up to 40 km wide
in this area;the Neckar in Mannheim and the Main;across from Mainz
In Mainz;and flows through the Mainz Basin
in the 19th Century
and the ground water level fell significantly
and the amount of forests;on the flood plains decreased sharply
On the French side;which carries a significant part of the river water;and all of the traffic
In some places;for example;the huge Bassin de compensation de Plobsheim;in Alsace

that;such as the Neckar , the Main;and , later , the Moselle , which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s;( 11,000 cu ft/s )
via the Moselle;smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands
via the Moselle
As it approaches the Dutch border;( 81,000 cu ft/s );( 1,300 ft )
Between Bingen and Bonn;a formation which was created by erosion
in the region;while the surrounding lands raised
and is the stretch;of the river;which is known for its many castles and vineyards
( 2002 );with more than 40 castles and fortresses;from the Middle Ages and many quaint and lovely country villages
Until the early 1980s
Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine;up into Switzerland;as the river passes the major cities of Cologne , Düsseldorf and Duisburg
to the sea ports of Rotterdam , Antwerp and Amsterdam
which joins the Rhine;in Duisburg;thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls , a transition;from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures;such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields

( 2,500 cu ft/s )
in the Ruhr Area;above all
dominant;in the Middle Rhine area
between Rüdesheim;am Rhein
Near Sankt Goarshausen
With its outstanding architectural monuments;the slopes full of vines , settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes

in particular;the agglomerations Cologne , Düsseldorf and Ruhr area
in Germany
in this region;in Europe;( Duisport )

which runs parallel;to the Lippe
Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge , the longest suspension bridge;in Germany
the line which separates the areas;where Low German and High German are spoken
From here;as the Dutch name Rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water
via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede;( De Biesbosch );merging with the Meuse;through the Hollands Diep and Haringvliet estuaries;into the North Sea
near Hardinxveld-Giessendam;to join the Lek , near the village of Kinderdijk , to form the Nieuwe Maas;then flows past Rotterdam and continues;via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg;to the North Sea
farther down rejoining the Nieuwe Maas;to form Het Scheur
and Nederrijn
( a former bay );while the Nederrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west;along a route parallel;to the Waal
However;at Wijk bij Duurstede
and to the North Sea
from here on;farther;to the north;which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times
Though they retained the name;but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders
From Wijk bij Duurstede;( " Bent Rhine " ) past Utrecht , first Leidse Rijn ( " Rhine of Leiden " ) and then , Oude Rijn;( " Old Rhine " )
at Katwijk;where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea
once;along
During periods of lower sea levels;within the various ice ages;left
the most important natural region;of the Netherlands;close to the Dutch-German border;with the division of the Rhine;into Waal and Nederrijn
Since the Rhine contributes most of the water;shorter
so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta , or even Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta;as the Scheldt ends in the same delta
The shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations :;at Millingen aan de Rijn;which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren , and second near Arnhem , the IJssel branches;off from the Nederrijn
two of which change names;rather often
largest;southern;and continues as Boven Merwede;( " Upper Merwede " );Beneden Merwede ( " Lower Merwede " );Noord River ( " North River " );Nieuwe Maas ( " New Meuse " );Het Scheur ( " the Rip " ) and Nieuwe Waterweg;( " New Waterway " )
then changes into Lek , then joins the Noord , thereby forming Nieuwe Maas
until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer
( " New Merwede " );which branches off from the southern branch;where it changes from Boven;to Beneden Merwede;the Oude Maas;( " Old Meuse " );which branches off from the southern branch;where it changes from Beneden Merwede;into Noord;and Dordtse Kil;which branches off from Oude Maas
Before the St. Elizabeth 's flood;( 1421 );just;of today 's line Merwede-Oude Maas;to the North Sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with Waal and Lek
estuary-like extended;many islands and constant changes;of the coastline
From 1421 to 1904;to form Merwede
For flood protection reasons;through a lock;and diverted into a new outlet called " Bergse Maas " , then Amer and then flows into the former bay Hollands Diep
disconnected arms ( Hollandse IJssel , Linge , Vecht , etc. ) and smaller rivers and streams
( " dammed " );for the numerous polders

or into former marine bays;now separated from the sea;in five places;namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede , Nieuwe Waterway;( Nieuwe Maas );Dordtse Kil , Spui and IJssel
shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers;but also by tidal currents
because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land;into the sea
Before the construction of the Delta Works;and even today;after the regulatory action of the Delta Works;the tide acts far inland
At the Waal;for example
In southern Europe;with the opening of the Tethys Ocean;between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates , between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP;( million years before present )

At about 180 MBP;in the Jurassic Period;causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate;in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods
Italy , the Alps , and Anatolia , moving west , the mountains of Greece and the islands
as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes
From the Eocene onwards;ongoing
in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands
By the time of the Miocene;that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river
At that time;instead , the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps
Through stream capture;southward
By the Pliocene period;including the Mosel , the Main and the Neckar

By the early Pleistocene period;from the Rhône;including the Aar
Since that time;( Vorderrhein , Hinterrhein , Alpenrhein ; captured from the Rhône );beyond Schweinfurt and the Vosges Mountains;to its watershed
( ending 11,600 years ago )
Since approximately 600,000 years ago;major;in which sea level dropped 120 m;( 390 ft );and much of the continental margins became exposed
In the Early Pleistocene;to the northwest
During the so-called Anglian glaciation;( ~450,000 yr BP , marine oxygen isotope stage 12 );that overflowed through the English Channel

Since then , during glacial times;France and rivers;like the Thames and the Seine;to the Rhine
During interglacials;when sea level rose to approximately the present level
( BP = Before Present );( ~11,600 BP )
In northwest Europe;peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000–24,000 BP
( Last Glacial Maximum )
During this time;and extended to the southwest , through the English Channel and finally;to the Atlantic Ocean
the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea;mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m ( 390 ft ) lower than today
during the last Ice Age;although , its source must still have been a glacier
with Ice Age flora and fauna;from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean
during the Last Glacial Maximum;ca. 22,000–14,000 yr BP , when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia , the Baltics , Scotland and the Alps , but left the space between as open tundra
wind-blown;over that tundra;contributing to its current agricultural usefulness
As northwest Europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward

to open
By 9000 BP
With globally shrinking ice-cover;and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated
adding to the ocean and land subsidence;transgressionally
Since 7500 yr ago;very similar to present
that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together , could compensate the transgression by the sea;in the last 7000 years;the coast line was roughly at the same location
In the southern North Sea;due to ongoing tectonic subsidence;at the rate of about 1–3 cm ( 0.39–1.18 in ) per century;( 1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years )
At the begin of the Holocene;( ~11,700 years ago )
As a meandering river
As sea-level continued to rise in the Netherlands;( ~8,000 years ago )
Coeval absolute sea-level;and tectonic subsidence
to the shape of the delta;as inherited from the Last Glacial and the coastal-marine dynamics;such as barrier and tidal inlet formations
Since ~3000 yr BP;( = years Before Present )
As a result of increasing land clearance;( Bronze Age agriculture );in the upland areas;( central Germany );and delta growth has sped up
and sedimentation;in the delta
to new locations;on the floodplain ( termed avulsion )
Over the past 6000 years
in the delta;for salt and fuel;from Roman times onward
of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries;which took place in the 11–13th century AD
Thereafter;and groynes were built , to prevent the river 's channels from migrating or silting up
At present;through the former Meuse estuary;near Rotterdam
formerly the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon;however , since 1932 , a freshwater lake
the River Waal ( 6/9 of total discharge );the River Nederrijn – Lek ( 2/9 of total discharge ) and the River IJssel;( 1/9 of total discharge )
including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century;with the help of weirs;in the Nederrijn river
and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC;in Roman-era geography
At that time
and by the 1st century BC;the areal;of the La Tène culture;covered almost its entire length , forming a contact zone;with the Jastorf culture , i.e. the locus of early Celtic-Germanic cultural contact
by definition;e.g. Maurus Servius Honoratus , Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil ( 8.727 ) ( Rhenus ) fluvius Galliae , qui Germanos a Gallia dividit " ( The Rhine is a ) river;of Gaul;which divides the Germanic people from Gaul
From the death of Augustus;in AD 14;until after AD 70
Beyond these rivers;opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum;( Mainz );the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads
where the Rhine is deep and broad;until the empire fell

and upper Danube

and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards
along the Rhine

Between about AD 14 and 180;( Xanten );( Pannonian troops );two legions at oppidum Ubiorum;( " town of the Ubii " );which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina , descending to Cologne , V Alaudae , a Celtic legion;recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and XXI;possibly a Galatian legion;from the other side of the empire
by the 5th century;establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine;Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia;on the High Rhine
such as the Nibelungenlied;which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels ( Siebengebirge );( " dragons rock " );near Bonn;at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court;at Worms;at the Rhine and Kriemhild 's golden treasure;which was thrown into the Rhine;by Hagen
By the 6th century
In the 9th;but in the 10th century;it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire , flowing through Swabia , Franconia and Lower Lorraine
in the county of Holland;in the 15th century;Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire;when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states
on the left banks of the Upper Rhine;by Archduke Sigismund of Austria;in 1469 and eventually fell to France;in the Thirty Years ' War
numerous;in Rhineland-Palatinate
Since the Peace of Westphalia
and is far more to the west
such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte
as a French client state;in 1806;and lasted until 1814;during which time;it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower;for the First French Empire
In 1840;prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers 's desire;to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border;in Germany
At the end of World War I
with the German army forbidden to enter
in general;and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitler 's rise;to power
and the German army re-occupied it in 1936;which was enormously popular in Germany
Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation;a feature of their policy of appeasement;to Hitler
In World War II
immortalized in the book;A Bridge Too Far and the film;during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944
over the Waal distributary of the Rhine
In a separate operation;crossing the Rhine at Remagen;much;to their own surprise;after the Germans failed to demolish it
at Remagen
to the River Rhine;during the Cold War
Until 1932;( 764 miles )
In 1932 the German encyclopedia;( 820 miles );presumably a typographical error
After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklopädie;and found its way;into numerous textbooks and official publications
and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at 1,232 kilometres;( 766 miles )
Following a referendum in 1997;in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution;which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature
the areas;in which it can make laws;by explicitly specifying powers;that are " reserved " to the Parliament of the United Kingdom
that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster
and can extend or reduce the areas;in which it can make laws

For the next three hundred years;both seated at Westminster;and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland;remained an important element in Scottish national identity
but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War
during the late 1960s;and in 1969;prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson;to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution
within the unitary state of the United Kingdom
to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs
During this time;in the North Sea;( SNP );for Scottish independence;as well as the SNP
as much as they should
in 1974
that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament
Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978;that represented at least 40 % of the total electorate
to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly
Although the vote was 51.6 % in favour of a Scottish Assembly;to pass the measure;as 32.9 % of the eligible voting population did not , or had been unable to , vote
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s;in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party;while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs
leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches , political parties and representatives of industry taking part
for devolution;in 1995
Since September 2004;in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh
in partnership;with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM;which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle
merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls;formed from the stones of previous buildings

in an official capacity
which reflects the desire;to encourage consensus;amongst elected members

Of the total 131 seats;the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General;for Scotland;who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members;of the Scottish Government
As such;and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but;as they are not elected MSPs

which are the first words of the Scotland Act , are inscribed around the head of the mace;which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament , reinforcing the authority of the Parliament;in its ability;to make laws
Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening;in July 1999;suspended from the lid
At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber
to late June;and from early September to mid December;with two-week recesses;in April and October
in the debating chamber;from 2 pm to 6 pm;and on Thursdays from 9 : 15 am to 6 pm

but booking in advance is recommended;due to limited space
and on the BBC 's parliamentary channel BBC Parliament
in print and online;which is the substantially verbatim transcript;of parliamentary debates
on Wednesdays;at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective;on issues of faith
which is the first item of business;in meetings of the House of Commons
and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs;according to the Scottish census
on the advice of the parliamentary bureau
to the Presiding Officer;to nominate speakers
( or Deputy Presiding Officer );for which they are allowed to speak
Normally;when selecting members to speak
Typically;with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time
if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate

rather than by constituency or cabinet position;and hand clapping is allowed
to the chamber;but members may use Scots , Gaelic , or any other language;with the agreement of the Presiding Officer
in the Gaelic language
Each sitting;normally at 5 pm;that have been moved that day
which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs;who are not in the chamber;to return and vote
At Decision Time;by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking " Are we all agreed ? ";to which the chamber first votes orally
If there is audible dissent;and members vote by means of electronic consoles;on their desks
when inserted into the console;identifies them and allows them to vote
As a result
since political parties normally instruct members;which way;to vote
known as whips;with the task of ensuring;that
since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties
during future elections;and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright
Thus;as with many Parliaments;and backbench rebellions;by members;who are discontent with their party 's policies;are rare
In some circumstances;however;which allows Members to vote as they please

Immediately after Decision Time;which lasts for 45 minutes
proposed by an MSP;who is not a Scottish minister
which may be of interest;to a particular area;such as a member 's own constituency , an upcoming or past event or any other item;which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time
As well as the proposer
whose department the debate and motion relate to;by speaking;after all other participants

than in other parliamentary systems;partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact;that there is no revising chamber
in the Scottish Parliament
when Parliament is sitting
throughout Scotland
with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament

which are set down under the Scottish Parliament 's standing orders;which govern their remits and proceedings
in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament;Equal Opportunities;European and External Relations;Finance;Public Petitions;Standards , Procedures and Public Appointments;and Delegated Powers and Law Reform

in a number of ways;the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments;to existing laws;as a bill;a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas;under its remit;a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill;as a private member;or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament;by an outside proposer
introduced by ministers in the governing party
in a number of stages
Explanatory Notes , a Policy Memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a Financial Memorandum;setting out the costs and savings;associated with it

for a full debate;in the chamber;on the general principles of the bill
If the whole Parliament agrees in a vote;to the general principles of the bill
and is considered at a meeting of the whole Parliament

designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken
After a general debate;on the final form of the bill
Royal assent :;After the bill has been passed;for royal assent
However;until a 4-week period has elapsed , during which the Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom;for a ruling;on whether it is within the powers of the Parliament

that reads : " The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on [ Date ] and received royal assent on [ Date ] "

In contrast to many other parliamentary systems;at the beginning of each parliamentary term;( after a general election )
and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament

Theoretically;also;who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet;but such ministers are , in practice , appointed to their roles;by the First Minister
who do not attend cabinet
the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General

Under the Scotland Act 1998;in May;every four years ( 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on )
to;either way by the Monarch;on the proposal of the Presiding Officer
If the Parliament;itself resolves that it should be dissolved;( with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour );or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant;and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen;by royal proclamation
unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election;in which case;they supplant it
following;a multiple of four years;after 1999 ( i.e. , 5 May 2011 , 7 May 2015 , etc. )

upon which MSPs are invited to question
For example;at the beginning of each parliamentary year;setting out the Government 's legislative programme;for the forthcoming year
After the statement has been delivered;on issues;related to the substance of the statement
in the debating chamber
between 11 : 40 a.m. and 12 p.m.;where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government
At 2.30pm;40-minute long;where members can ask questions of ministers;in departments;that are selected for questioning that sitting day;such as health and justice or education and transport
Between 12 p.m. and 12 : 30 p.m.;on Thursdays;when Parliament is sitting
under their jurisdiction

who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue
general;available;to opposition leaders
Of the 129 MSPs;and are known as " Constituency MSPs "
and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP
prior to the 2005 reduction;in the number of Scottish MPs;with the exception of Orkney and Shetland;which each return their own constituency MSP
Currently;average
Given the geographical distribution;of population;in Scotland;where the bulk of Scotland 's population live , and much larger constituency areas;in the north and west of the country;which have a low population density
due to their dispersed population and distance;from the Scottish Parliament;in Edinburgh
If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament;in his or her constituency;where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system
to the number of votes;received in the second vote of the ballot using the d ' Hondt method
cast for each party;is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region;( at this point just constituency seats )
with the highest quotient;which is then added to its constituency seats;in allocating the second seat
iteratively;until all available list seats are allocated
As in the House of Commons

Specifically;and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom , the Republic of Ireland , one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations , a citizen of a British overseas territory , or a European Union citizen resident;in the UK
and similarly , civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified
if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health ( Care and Treatment ) ( Scotland ) Act 2003
making this the first time;in the Scottish Parliament;where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority
with many of their key figures;not returned to parliament;although Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes
from the Liberal Democrats;and one seat from the Conservatives

For the Conservatives;the seat of former party leader David McLetchie
and the Conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats;with leader Annabel Goldie claiming;that their support had held firm


that applies only to England , Wales and Northern Ireland – whilst English , Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs;are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament
and has led to criticism
Following the Conservative victory;in the 2015 UK election;over laws only affecting England
also known as Political Islam;( Arabic : إسلام سياسي‎ islām siyāsī );often characterized by moral conservatism , literalism , and the attempt ";to implement Islamic values;in all spheres of life;"
in accordance;with the Shari ' a
at one end;through state power;seized by revolution or invasion;at the other " reformist " pole Islamists work to Islamize society gradually " from the bottom up "
since the modern states gained independence;redefining " politics and even borders " according to one journalist;( Robin Wright )
Moderate and;who accept and work within the democratic process;like the Tunisian Ennahda Movement
is basically a socio-political and democratic Vanguard;in past
like Hezbollah;in Lebanon and Hamas;in Palestine
like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad;and groups such as the Taliban;entirely;often declaring as kuffar those Muslims who support it;( see takfirism );as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks;on a religious basis
within;( Salafis , such as those in the Wahhabi movement );centered around the Muslim Brotherhood
when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on " sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions , " and rejection;of Shia Islam
Following the Arab Spring;with democracy;in much of the Arab Muslim world;such that " neither can now survive without the other;"
While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic
At the same time;that excludes mainstream Islamist groups
for Islam;but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect Islam;while the contrary idea;that Islam is , or can be , apolitical is an error
who do not believe that Islam is merely a political ideology;John Esposito and Muslim intellectuals;like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi
to distinguish between Islam and Islamism;to support illiberal Islamic regimes;to the detriment of progressive moderates;who seek to separate religion from politics
how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal , social , political , economic , and political spheres of life are not Muslims , but Islamists;not [ just ] Islam

( see other ) based on racial , religious , or cultural stereotypes


however , it is still a powerful;form of dominance
and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers , or simply , general-purpose aggressiveness
Further on;[ who ? ];in slightly more discriminating fashion;over another
while the second implied less direct rule;though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance

because;with informal rule;the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority , enforcing land officials into large debts;that can not be repaid
for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be sovereignty , or simply rule;"
through;that a nation has conquered and expanded
however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes
about empires;" that although political;economic and cultural;"
went overseas
in Asia and Africa;";and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires "

and the periphery
the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum;consisting of areas of low income and profit
on the modern post-colonial world

from Lenin
in the market;some states today are viewed as empires;due to their political and economic authority;over other nations

in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people

in modern usage;between the colony and the imperial power
Particularly;imperialism involved the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory;while colonialism refers to the implanting of settlements;on a distant territory
such as the Russian or Ottoman
as it lacks a political focus
both;yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference;between the two
Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other;if colonialism;either formally or informally
and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism
when;over an area;and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled
that was conquered;and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war

in an area;by a population;coming from a foreign region
it is not unusual;that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations
in Europe;who would come back with tales of their discoveries
these stories
such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain;also
while Mackinder supported Britain 's imperial expansion;these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades

For instance
as the west 's construction of the east as the " other "
According to Siad;which justified its dominance;over the essentialized Orient
during the last generation;and proceeds rather by diagnosis;than by historical description;"
( Latin expression which stems from Roman law meaning ' empty land ' )
in the eighteenth century;as it was premised on terra nullius;and its settlers considered it unused;by its sparse Aboriginal inhabitants
as theorized by Edward Said
that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality;of the East
Rather;to create difference and distance;between " we " the West and " them " the East , or " here " in the West and " there ";in the East
that positioned the East as irrational and backward;in opposition;to the rational and progressive West
as its inferior , not only increased the West 's sense of self , but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so;that it could be dominated and controlled
as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas;that rationalized social , cultural , political , and economic control of other territories
To better illustrate this idea

During his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques
to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps
Korea , the Assyrian Empire , the Chinese Empire , the Roman Empire , Greece , the Byzantine Empire , the Persian Empire , the Ottoman Empire , Ancient Egypt , the British Empire , India , and many other empires
during the Mongol Empire;and of other war-lords

that predate the European colonial era;for example;the Ethiopian Empire , Oyo Empire , Asante Union , Luba Empire , Lunda Empire , and Mutapa Empire
during the pre-Columbian era;also;such as the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire
i.e. its soft power;such that it changes the moral , cultural and societal worldview of another
but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted
in North Korea
fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture , control;of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes;etc
recent;as part of Roman imperialism local elites;would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle;with the aim;that they would then become willing participants
a time period beginning around 1700;( generally European );influencing , and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power
Although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years;from the early 18th century;through to the middle of the 20th century , for example , the " The Great Game " in Persian lands , the " Scramble for Africa " and the " Open Door Policy ";in China
During the 20th century;historians;( 1919–1980 );( 1920–1999 )
and Europeans rejected the notion;that " imperialism " required formal , legal control by one government;over another country
In their view;with regions colored red
trade , and capital
informally if possible and formally if necessary
Because of the resources made available;by imperialism;and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I , making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous
by collecting resources from colonies;in combination;with assuming political control;by military and political means
The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus :;while military activity was important at various times;for the establishment of control;over the subcontinent 's resources , markets , and manpower
Although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
Along with advancements in communication
that could be used in combat;and with innovations;in machinery;they were able to manufacture improved firearms
By the 1880s
as armies in less-developed countries;were still fighting with arrows , swords , and leather shields;( e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 )
In anglophone academic works
in its present sense;in the late 1870s;by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli
such as Joseph Chamberlain
For some;imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy

in particular;with his work Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism
In his writings;that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower;in such a way;that necessitated colonial expansion
as a structural feature of capitalism
Many;on the left
associated with the term;so that it now designates neither a policy , nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century;but a world system extending over a period of centuries , often going back to Christopher Columbus and;to the Crusades
As the application of the term has expanded;but often parallel axes :;the moral , the economic , the systemic , the cultural , and the temporal
even squeamishness , with the fact of power , specifically , Western power
concept;for domination of certain territories and peoples
in which they lived;and thus validated their domination
For example;living in tropical environments
Across the three waves of European colonialism;( first in the Americas , second in Asia and lastly in Africa )
orientalism and tropicality
According to geographic scholars;under colonizing empires

Alternatively;sexual promiscuity , exotic culture , and moral degeneracy
from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure;they were seen as incapable of such a feat

Eventually;and civilians assisting them
while the entire civilian population was expelled

After World War II;under a Communist regime;set up by the conquering Soviets;for Warsaw;and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw;to address the housing shortage;along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city , such as the Palace of Culture and Science , a gift from the Soviet Union
as the capital of Poland and the country 's centre of political and economic life

and the avenues are a place;to sit and relax
At the east end of the park
In the 19th century
Within the central area of the park;black walnut , Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees
With its benches;flower carpets , a pond;with ducks on and a playground;for kids


( pavilions , sculptures , bridges , cascades , ponds );( domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes )

Demographically;with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants
In addition to the Polish majority
According to Russian census of 1897;out of the total population of 638,000;( around 34 % percent )
of more than 350,000

and to this day;there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw 's history

In 1939;but in 1945 only 420,000
During the first years;after the war;so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas;for new houses
( 1951 );but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations : only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance ( like renowned specialists ) were allowed to get the registration , hence halving the population growth in the following years
among Poles;because they lived in the capital
Unfortunately;( although not as much as it used to be );even;though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore
Throughout its existence
According to the 1901 census;35.7 % Jews , 5 % Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8 % Protestants

An example of such entitlement is a car registration :;( i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered , not gmina )
In this case
Kraków , Gdańsk , Poznań
like already mentioned car registration
For example;and the district Ursynów – its own;( and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów )
But;for instance;so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type;for all districts

to the forts;on the Ohio , and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses;at Frontenac;against Shirley 's expected attack
When Johnson was seen as the larger threat;to meet;that threat
at the upper end of navigation;on the Hudson River;but Johnson had strongly fortified it , and Dieskau 's Indian support was reluctant to attack
between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry

and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point;where they began the construction of Fort Carillon;( later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759 )

combined with other failures in the European theater;from power of Newcastle;and his principal military advisor;the Duke of Cumberland
in which Pitt dominated the military planning
for the 1758 campaign;that was largely developed by Loudoun
as commander;in chief;after the failures of 1757
supported by the provincial militias;aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France

in which 3,600 Frenchmen famously and decisively defeated Abercrombie 's force of 18,000 regulars , militia and Native American allies;outside the fort the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga
when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition;that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac , including caches;of supplies;destined for New France 's western forts and furs;destined for Europe
and replaced by Jeffery Amherst , victor;at Louisbourg
In the aftermath of generally poor French results;in most theaters of the Seven Years ' War;in 1758;new foreign;the duc de Choiseul;to draw British resources away;from North America and the European mainland
both militarily and politically;as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France , and sent funds;to Britain 's ally;on the mainland , Prussia;and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles;at Lagos and Quiberon Bay
In one piece of good fortune;eluding the British blockade of the French coast
when they finally captured Ticonderoga;defeated Montcalm at Quebec;( in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders );and victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south

In September 1760;and before any hostilities erupted
who chose to remain in the colony;continued ownership of their property , and the right;to remain undisturbed in their homes
were returned to France;aboard British ships;with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war
on 10 February 1763;and war;in the European theatre of the Seven Years ' War;was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg;on 15 February 1763
which had been occupied by the British
but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , two small islands;in the Gulf of St. Lawrence;along with fishing rights in the area
from the continent
contemporaneous French;disparagingly
for their part;as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar
which traded Florida to Britain;to regain Cuba;including New Orleans , from France;in compensation;for its losses

colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents
from Europe and the colonies;further south
but many went to France;and some went to New Orleans;which they had expected to remain French
these latter efforts were unsuccessful
like Saint-Domingue;after the Haitian Revolution

then to " Cajun "
Following the treaty;on October 7 , 1763;which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and to some extent continues to govern relations;between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations
that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers
that prevented civic participation;by the Roman Catholic Canadians

Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory ( which was not completed until 1769 ) had modest repercussions;that did not want to do business with the British;and a rise in tensions;between the Choctaw and the Creek;historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited
in Florida
including the entire governmental records;from St. Augustine;although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico
in antiquity;but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force
In part;to;incomplete;and a consequently inadequate
that a force is required to maintain motion;even at a constant velocity
about motion and force
With his mathematical insight;that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years
By the early 20th century;that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces;produced by gravitation and inertia
With modern insights;into quantum mechanics and technology;that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light;between particles smaller than atoms
called gauge bosons
in order of decreasing strength;they are : strong , electromagnetic , weak , and gravitational
made
as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology
In Aristotle 's view
composed mostly of the elements earth and water
( e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall );which led to " natural motion " , and unnatural or forced motion;which required continued application of a force
based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving;such as the flight of arrows
and while the projectile sailed through the air;no discernible efficient cause acts;on it
displaced through the projectile 's path
in general
who was influenced by the late Medieval idea;that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus
in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early;in the 17th century
that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force;for example friction
unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force
of Galileo 's insight;( see a more detailed description of this below )
that functions;as the fundamental equilibrium " natural state ";in place of the Aristotelian idea of the " natural state of rest "
That is
By making rest physically indistinguishable;from non-zero constant velocity;directly
Specifically;in systems;where objects are moving with different velocities
In other words;to phrase matters more technically;that is , in all frames;related by a Galilean transformation
For instance;while traveling in a moving vehicle;at a constant velocity
and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving
even though another person;who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also;observes;as the motion of the vehicle
associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle 's motion;that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down
From the perspective of the person;in the car;the vehicle and everything inside of it;is at rest :;that is moving with a constant speed;in the opposite direction
Since there is no experiment;that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest
as it does to rest
to;even those that are not strictly constant velocity
and the length of a year


If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next;to himself;due to its inertia
that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space;with no net force of gravity;acting on their shared reference frame
for the development of the general theory of relativity
and the inverse proportionality of acceleration;to mass

while kinematics are well-described;through reference frame analysis;in advanced physics;that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass
but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity , it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant;on microscales
With some justification;by writing the law as an equality;the relative units of force and mass then are fixed
where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects
[ Note 3 ]
Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body
in direction
with F called the " action " and −F the " reaction "

that are unbalanced
That is;action-reaction;shared between any two objects in a closed system
to each other
Alternatively;if an external force acts on the system;then;divided by the mass of the system
Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls
As with other physical concepts;( e.g. temperature );that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale
Through experimentation

Because of these characteristics
that do not have direction;( denoted scalar quantities )
For example;when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object
If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force
For example;if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling
as in tug of war or;the two people could be pulling in the same direction
In this simple one-dimensional example

Historically;where several forces canceled each other out
that forces are additive vector quantities :;they have magnitude and direction
When two forces act on a point particle;( also called the net force );the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector;that is equal in magnitude and direction;to the transversal of the parallelogram
depending on the angle;between their lines of action
However;if the forces are acting on an extended body;also;in order to account for their effects;on the motion of the body
As well as being added;also;at right angles;to each other
pointing northeast;therefore;one pointing north , and one pointing east

to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions
is because , for orthogonal components;uniquely;addition of the components of the individual vectors
because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect;on the magnitude or direction of the other

that is in the same direction;as one of the forces;since that force would then have only one non-zero component

on a frictional surface;can result in a situation;where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction;generated between the object and the table surface
For a situation;with no movement;exactly;resulting in no acceleration
to the applied force;up to an upper limit;determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object
between two forces;using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances
For example;acting on the object;balanced by a force;applied by the " spring reaction force ";which equals the object 's weight
( widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights );Archimedes ' principle;for buoyancy;Archimedes ' analysis;of the lever;Boyle 's law;for gas pressure;and Hooke 's law;for springs
before Isaac Newton expounded his Three Laws of Motion
who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic


that objects with mass naturally approached

For example;if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow 's nest of a ship;moving at a constant velocity
Thus;in an Aristotelian universe
However;when this experiment is actually conducted;as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it
Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball;as it falls;as it falls

across a surface;with kinetic friction
In such a situation;while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force
but since the object started with a non-zero velocity

However;when kinetic friction is taken into consideration
though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the Schrödinger equation instead of Newtonian equations
that the results of a measurement are now sometimes " quantized "

However;( x , y , z );from which the forces generally can be derived;i.e. ,
However;already in quantum mechanics;namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable , but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the " spin ";relating the space and the spin variables
Depending on the value of the spin;fermions and bosons
If two identical fermions ( e.g. electrons ) have a symmetric spin;( e.g. parallel spins );( i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force );( i.e. the apparent force must be attractive )
Thus;in the case of two fermions;whereas for two bosons ( e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves , photons ) the correlation is strictly positive
In modern particle physics
With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity;( 4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics )
and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force

When particle A emits ( creates ) or absorbs ( annihilates ) virtual particle B;in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction;between particles A A ' exchanging;by B
arising from fundamental interactions
While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate;result of such interactions
In a Feynman diagram;( see world line );traveling through time;which normally increases up;or to the right;in the diagram
except for their direction of propagation;through the Feynman diagram
arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines
as wavy lines;and , in the case of virtual particle exchange , are absorbed at an adjacent vertex
in the universe
that act only at very short distances , and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles , including nucleons and compound nuclei
and the gravitational force acts between masses
other;in nature
For example;acting between the atoms of two surfaces;which does not permit atoms to pass through each other
Similarly;modeled by Hooke 's law
that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference
for forces
For example

In the 20th century;( all except gravity );( fermions )
and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation

with the strong force;with candidate theories;such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems;in physics
that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything
but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory
until the work of Isaac Newton
Before Newton

Today;towards the surface of the Earth;per second squared;( this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location )

that has a;of

In particular;if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law

that relates the mass ( ) and the radius;( );of the Earth;to the gravitational acceleration
In this equation
though its value was unknown in Newton 's lifetime
Not until 1798;was Henry Cavendish able to make the first measurement of using a torsion balance;as a measurement of the mass of the Earth;since knowing could allow one to solve for the Earth 's mass given the above equation

of the planet;that Newton 's Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain
Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet;( Vulcan );that would explain the discrepancies
When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity;( GR );which could account for the discrepancy
that Newton 's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative
Since then , and so far
In GR;moving freely in gravitational fields;in straight lines;through curved space-time;defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events
From the perspective of the object
only when observing the motion in a global sense;and the force is inferred from the object 's curved path
in space-time
For example;as it is in a uniform gravitational field
( when the extra ct dimension is added );slightly curved ( with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years )

Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge;called
that acts on a charge
( due to the electric field );( due to the magnetic field )
Fully stated
when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories;into a set of 20 scalar equations;which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations;by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs
and the interactions of the fields themselves
that traveled at a speed;that he calculated to be the speed of light
and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum
However;the photoelectric effect , and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe
Through the work of leading theoretical physicists
final;to electromagnetic theory;( or QED )
In QED;which described all interactions;relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force
under the influence of the electromagnetic force

Since electrons are fermions
When the electrons in a material are densely packed together;all , so some of them must be in higher energy states

While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force
only;elementary
( the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei );as the nuclear force
Here;indirectly;which form part of the virtual pi;and rho mesons;which classically transmit the nuclear force;( see this topic for more )



most;( of neutrons in atomic nuclei ) and the associated radioactivity
that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force
Still;over short distances
which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures;in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins
and show the conditions of the universe;in the early moments of the Big Bang
between atoms;at close contact
( due to fermionic nature of electrons );that acts in a direction normal;to the surface interface;between two objects
normal;for example
in action
that are massless , frictionless , unbreakable , and unstretchable
which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction
so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string , any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force;directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object
By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up;that uses movable pulleys
For every string;that acts on a load
in force;that must be displaced in order to move the load
since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine
in general
However;in real life;that act on one part of an object;might affect other parts of an object
For situations;where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow , contract , expand , or otherwise change shape
For example;in extended fluids;as
the relevant cross-sectional;for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated
that act normal to the cross-sectional area;( the matrix diagonals of the tensor );as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area;( the off-diagonal elements )
that cause all strains ( deformations ) including also tensile stresses and compressions
in the same way;that angle is the rotational equivalent for position , angular velocity for velocity , and angular momentum;for momentum
As a consequence of Newton 's First Law of Motion;that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque
Likewise;for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body
from the center
felt by any object
associated with the motion of an object;and therefore do not change the speed of the object;( magnitude of the velocity );but only the direction;of the velocity vector
that accelerates an object;that is perpendicular to the path;and one that is tangential to the path
( centripetal );which changes its direction
that acts on a closed system

therefore;between two different locations;in space;and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way;that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area
For certain physical scenarios
that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates
For example;between the atoms;but manifests as a force model;that is independent of any macroscale position vector
other than friction;tension , compression , and drag
However;for any sufficiently detailed description;since each of these macroscopic forces are the net;results of the gradients of microscopic potentials
with statistical mechanics
In macroscopic closed systems
According to the Second law of thermodynamics;within closed systems;from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases
the kilogram-force ( kgf );( sometimes kilopond );is the force;exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass
leads to an alternate , but rarely used unit;of mass :;( sometimes mug or hyl )
The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system , and is generally deprecated;as expressing aircraft weight , jet thrust
which is equivalent to 1000 N
