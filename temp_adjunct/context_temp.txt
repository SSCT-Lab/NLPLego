The Normans t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 were the people t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 .
They were descended from Norse t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 raiders and pirates t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 who , under their leader Rollo , agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia .
The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Norman dynasty had a major political , t0 t0 t0 impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East .
The Normans were famed for their martial spirit t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Duchy of Normandy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was a great fief of medieval France , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
The Normans are noted both for their culture , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 .
Norman cultural t0 t0 influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
The English name " Normans " comes from the French words Normans/Normanz , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 evolved into more permanent encampments t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Duchy of Normandy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine .
The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , its populations did not differ from Picardy or the Île-de-France , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
Rollo 's contingents t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 included Danes , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The descendants of Rollo 's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism t0 t0 t0 and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people , blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'oïl branch of Romance t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Most Norman knights remained poor t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Many Normans of Italy , t0 t0 t0 eventually served t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they entered the Byzantine Empire t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces t0 t0 .
There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It is also unknown how many of the " Franks " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , were Normans t1 t1 t1 t1 .
One of the first Norman mercenaries t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was Hervé in the 1050s .
t0 t0 t0 , there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia .
They were based at Malatya and Edessa , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa t1 t1 t1 .
Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , many took up service with the Armenian state t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A Norman t0 t0 led a force of " Franks " into the upper Euphrates valley t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans — t1 t1 t1 — t2 t2 t2 .
They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle : t0 , t0 t0 t0 . t1
The t0 trade between Amalfi and Antioch t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul , the Petraliphae t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Robert Guiscard , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania , t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines t1 t1 t1 .
The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Venetian fleet had secured a victory t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The city 's garrison resisted until February 1082 , when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; they took Ioannina and some minor cities t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Dissension t0 t0 t0 t0 coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy .
They lost Dyrrachium , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , the Normans t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , Robert 's son , landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 , they occupied Petrela , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , the Albanians sided with the Normans , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the Normans secured the Arbanon passes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The lack of supplies , disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack t0 t0 , when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , Dyrrachium — t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 — fell again to Byzantine hands .
The Normans were in contact with England t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging t0 t0 t0 , they occupied most of the important ports t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , Ethelred fled to Normandy t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
His stay in Normandy t0 t0 t0 t0 influenced him and his sons by Emma , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , he brought with him a Norman-educated mind .
He t0 brought many Norman counsellors and fighters , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This concept never really took root , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II , t0 t0 t0 to his court in 1051 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , Duke William II of Normandy conquered England t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 Normans t1 t1 t1 replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England .
The nobility of England were part of a single Normans culture t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Early Norman kings of England , t0 t0 t0 t0 , owed homage to the King of France t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
They considered England to be their most important holding t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the Normans merged with the natives , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English .
The Anglo-Norman language became distinct from the Latin language , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It t0 t0 evolved into Modern English .
The Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity .
t0 , t1 t1 , t2 came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became " more Irish than the Irish themselves . "
The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Both cultures intermixed , borrowing from each other 's language , t0 t0 t0 .
Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames .
Names t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Other Norman names t0 t0 t0 predominate there .
Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell t0 t0 t0 derived from the French Norman name Morel .
Other names t0 t0 Fitz t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 indicate Norman ancestry .
These included Fitzgerald , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 .
t0 families t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 are t3 of Norman extraction .
One of the claimants of the English throne t0 t0 t0 t0 , Edgar Atheling , eventually fled to Scotland .
King Malcolm III of Scotland married Edgar 's sister Margaret , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
William invaded Scotland in 1072 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Malcolm submitted , paid homage to William and surrendered his son Duncan as a hostage , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Normans came into Scotland , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
King David I of Scotland , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 married Sybilla t1 t1 , was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , David had to reward many with lands .
The process was continued under David 's successors , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Scottish families t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , can all be traced back to Norman ancestry .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Normans had come into contact with Wales .
Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 , the Marches came completely under the dominance of William 's most trusted Norman barons , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
These Normans began a long period of slow conquest t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Norman words , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , first entered Welsh at that time .
The legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
They were major foreign participants in the Reconquista t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , Roger de Tosny travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from Moorish lands , t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , William of Montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty .
t0 t0 , Crusaders passing by the siege of Amalfi were joined by Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred with an army of Italo-Normans .
Bohemond was the de facto leader of the Crusade t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city .
Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of Jerusalem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
The conquest of Cyprus t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 opened a new chapter in the history of the island , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the conquest had much more permanent results than t2 expected .
t0 t0 t0 Richard the Lion-hearted left Messina with a large fleet in order to reach Acre .
But a storm dispersed the fleet .
t0 t0 t0 , it was discovered that the boat t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus , together with the wrecks of several other ships , including the treasure ship .
Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island 's despot Isaac Komnenos .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Richard 's fleet arrived in the port of Limassol t1 t1 .
He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure .
Isaac refused , t0 Richard landed t1 t1 and took Limassol .
Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
All declared their support t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The local barons abandoned Isaac , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape .
Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , Richard had conquered the whole island .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island .
Richard left for Acre t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , he named two of his Norman generals , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , as governors of Cyprus .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the expedition t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 Salle conquered the Canarian islands of Lanzarote , Fuerteventura and El Hierro t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Their troops were gathered in Normandy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Bethencourt took the title of King of the Canary Islands , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , Jean 's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The customary law of Normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 : These are the Très ancien coutumier t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 ; t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 , t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
Norman architecture typically stands out as a new stage t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They spread a unique Romanesque idiom to England and Italy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Their style was characterised by rounded arches , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the Anglo-Saxon and precedes the Early Gothic .
t0 t0 t0 , the Normans incorporated elements of Islamic , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 the dukes began a programme of church reform , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The church was utilised by the dukes t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The chief monasteries taking part in this " renaissance " of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel , Fécamp , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 .
These centres were in contact t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The French Wars of Religion t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity .
The former , t0 t0 t0 , caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices ; t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
t0 t0 the most famous work of Norman art is the Bayeux Tapestry , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It was commissioned by Odo , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork , such as capitals and baptismal fonts .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 , Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the crown is Byzantine in style t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Many churches preserve sculptured fonts , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 south Italian churches preserve works from France t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education .
t0 t0 , under two Italian abbots , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the system of denoting notes t2 t2 was developed and taught .
It is still the most common form of pitch representation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 .
t0 t1 t1 , the staff , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , was first developed and taught in the 11th century .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , La Trinité-du-Mont became a centre of musical composition .
At Saint Evroul , a tradition of singing had developed t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
There they continued the tradition of singing .
Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A computational problem is understood to be a task t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Other complexity measures are also used , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits t0 t0 t0 t0 and can not do .
t0 t0 fields in theoretical computer science are analysis t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , it tries to classify problems that can or can not be solved with appropriately restricted resources .
t0 t0 , imposing restrictions t1 t1 t1 t1 is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory : t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 .
A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved .
t0 t0 , an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , consider the problem of primality testing .
The instance is a number t0 t0 t0 t0 and the solution is " yes " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , the instance is a particular input to the problem , and the solution is the output t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet .
t0 , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , mathematical objects t1 t1 t1 must be suitably encoded .
t0 t0 , integers can be represented in binary notation , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Decision problems are one of the central objects of study t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A decision problem is a special type of computational problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The objective is to decide , with the aid of an algorithm , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the algorithm is said to accept the input string , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
An example of a decision problem is the following .
The input is an arbitrary graph .
The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected , or not .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 — of course , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings .
A function problem is a computational problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems .
However , this is not really the case , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem .
t0 , the running time may , t1 t1 , depend on the instance .
In particular , larger instances will require more time t0 t0 .
Thus the time required to solve a problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is calculated as a function of the size of the instance .
This is usually taken to be the size of the input t0 t0 .
Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size .
t0 t0 , in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected , how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph t1 t1 t1 compared to the time taken for a graph t2 t2 t2 ?
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the time taken can be expressed as a function of n .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the t1 t1 complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm .
Cobham 's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A Turing machine is a mathematical model t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It is a theoretical device t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 — t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm , there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem .
Indeed , this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis .
t0 , it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 can be computed on a Turing machine .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory .
A t0 Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits .
The ability t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 helps algorithms solve problems t1 t1 .
Algorithms t0 t0 t0 bits are called randomized algorithms .
A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is said to have solved the problem .
t0 , this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model , it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , see non-deterministic algorithm .
Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They are all equally powerful in principle , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , some of these may be more powerful than others .
t0 machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power .
The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary .
What t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is that the machines operate deterministically .
However , some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources .
t0 t0 , a t1 Turing machine is a computational model t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a computational model t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 is used .
The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n) , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , one defines sets of problems based on some criteria .
t0 t0 , the set of problems solvable t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)) .
Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource .
Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms .
t0 complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The best , worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 of different inputs of the same size .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , we define the following complexities .
t0 t0 , consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort .
This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n) .
The best case occurs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity , t0 t0 t0 .
Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , one t1 t1 t1 t1 that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T(n) .
t0 , proving lower bounds is much more difficult , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The phrase " all possible algorithms " includes not just the algorithms t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than T(n) .
Upper and t0 bounds are usually stated using the big O notation , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 one would write T(n) = O(n2) .
t0 t0 , some complexity classes have complicated definitions t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , a t1 complexity class has a definition t2 t2 t2 .
But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) t0 yields complexity classes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the language t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that " the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related " t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This forms the basis t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The corresponding set of function problems is FP .
t0 t0 complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Some important complexity classes of decision problems t0 t0 t0 manner are the following .
t0 t0 complexity classes include BPP , ZPP and RP , which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines ; t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
# P is an important complexity class of counting problems t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Classes t0 t0 t0 t0 are defined using Interactive proof systems .
ALL is the class of all decision problems .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on t2 t2 t2 computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems t1 .
They are called hierarchy theorems t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 there are pairs of complexity classes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the time hierarchy theorem tells us t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction .
A reduction is a transformation of one problem t0 t0 t0 .
It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , X is no more difficult than Y , and we say that X reduces to Y .
There are many different types of reductions , based on the method of reduction , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The t0 t0 used reduction is a t1 reduction .
This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time .
t0 t0 , the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers .
This means an algorithm t0 t0 t0 t0 can be used to square an integer .
Indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm .
Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class .
A problem X is hard for a class of problems C t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 no problem in C is harder than X , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , polynomial-time reductions are commonly used .
t0 t0 , the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 X is said to be complete for C .
This means that X is the hardest problem in C .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C .
t0 the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1 .
This is t0 a t1 solution to Π1 would yield a t2 solution to Π2 .
Similarly , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP .
The t0 class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis .
The t0 class NP , t1 t1 t1 t1 , contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP .
The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions .
These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The P t0 t0 t0 is one of the Millennium Prize Problems t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
There is a US $ 1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem .
It was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist problems in NP t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems .
The graph isomorphism problem , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate .
They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The t0 t0 problem is t1 t1 t1 of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic .
An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P , NP-complete , or NP-intermediate .
The answer is not known , but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 graph isomorphism is not NP-complete .
The best algorithm for this problem , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 has run time 2O(√(n log(n))) for graphs t1 t1 t1 .
The integer factorization problem is the computational problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k .
No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The integer factorization problem is in NP t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 t0 algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , the t1 t1 quantum algorithm t2 t2 t2 , Shor 's algorithm , does run in polynomial time .
Unfortunately , this fact does n't say much t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 to non-quantum complexity classes .
t0 t0 complexity classes are suspected to be unequal , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , but it is possible that P = PSPACE .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , then P is not equal to PSPACE t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class .
Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , co-NP is the class containing the complement problems t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 of NP problems .
It is believed that NP is not equal to co-NP ; t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP .
Similarly , it is not known if L t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is strictly contained in P or equal to P .
t0 , there are many complexity classes between the two , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Problems that can be solved in theory t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , are known as intractable problems .
t0 t0 t0 , problems t1 t1 t1 t1 are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs .
t0 t0 , the Cobham–Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device .
Problems t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 sense include those t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 practice , consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the program would run for about 4 × 1010 years , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the program would only be useful for very small instances t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Nevertheless , a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , it is unreasonable to consider it efficient t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 practice is open to debate .
Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are .
t0 t0 , the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers .
t0 influential among these was the definition of Turing machines t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal paper t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 , t1 t1 Edmonds defined a " good " algorithm as one t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Earlier papers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 resources include John Myhill 's definition of linear bounded automata t1 t1 t1 t1 , Raymond Smullyan 's study of rudimentary sets t2 t2 t2 , as well as Hisao Yamada 's paper on real-time computations t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , Boris Trakhtenbrot t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , studied another specific complexity measure .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding .
This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently .
t0 t0 , Manuel Blum developed an axiomatic complexity theory based on his axioms and proved an important result , t1 t1 , t1 t1 .
The field really began to flourish in 1971 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 .

The last Prime Minister of the t0 t0 t0 German Democratic Republic , Lothar de Maizière , is also a descendant of a Huguenot family , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
Steam engines are external combustion engines , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Non-combustion heat sources t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 may be used .
The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle .
t0 t0 t0 , water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , mechanical work is done .
The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler .
The first t0 successful true engine , t1 t1 it t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , was the t3 engine , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
It was an improvement over Savery 's steam pump , using a piston t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Newcomen 's engine was relatively inefficient , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston t0 t0 t0 .
It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible , and also for providing a reusable water supply t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 sited away from a suitable " head " .
Water t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was pumped back up into a storage reservoir t1 t1 t1 .
The first t0 t0 railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t9 t9 t9 .
The design incorporated a number of important innovations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Rankine cycle t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have a water pump t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 , other types are used .
Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Injectors became popular in the 1850s t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It is a logical extension of the compound engine t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The result is the multiple expansion engine .
Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively .
These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter .
These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage .
Multiple expansion engines t0 had the cylinders arranged inline , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines .
Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , there were attempts t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , variable cutoff expansion valve t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and the mechanism tended to be complicated .
The t0 compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
This expedient has t0 been generally considered satisfactory t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler 's firebox .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the lead melts t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire .
The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew .
t0 t0 James Watt patented a steam engine t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Watt 's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery t0 t0 t0 .
The engines could be sited anywhere t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible .
The stationary steam engine was a key component t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century AD ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the few t1 t1 engines t2 known were , like the aeolipile , essentially experimental devices used by inventors t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
A t0 steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions , including a water pump t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Denis Papin , a t0 t0 , did some useful work t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 came into widespread use .
Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
These stages were called expansions , with double and triple expansion engines being common , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Steam engines remained the dominant source of power t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Steam turbines t0 replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines .
t0 t0 t0 t0 90 % of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources .
Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 the heat source is a nuclear reactor , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the heat source can be an electric heating element .
The most useful instrument t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is the steam engine indicator .
Early versions were in use by 1851 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It was routinely used by engineers , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines .
See image of indicator diagram below t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the pistons are connected to the cranks t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
When t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , the individual pistons t1 t1 t1 are usually balanced at 180° , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the LP cranks were either set at 90° t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the steam reverses its direction of flow t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 – t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 .
These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 making the steam flow only in one direction .
t0 t0 t0 , the t1 uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 , the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives t1 t1 .
The Quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
An t0 cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the entire cylinder rocks , or oscillates , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
These engines are mainly used in toys and models , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The t0 fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 .
t0 water is the fluid of choice t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine .
Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle .
The efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 , turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C .
This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63 % t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This low turbine entry temperature t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations .
Steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the Industrial Revolution and saw widespread commercial use t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Their use in agriculture led to an increase in the land available t0 t0 .
There have at one time or another been steam-powered farm tractors , motorcycles t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and even automobiles as the Stanley Steamer .
Trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the t1 t1 locomotive Salamanca t2 t2 t2 was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway .
t0 t0 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway .
This was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829 , he built The Rocket t0 t0 t0 t0 and won the Rainhill Trials .
The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A method t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was invented in 1804 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 steam t2 t2 t2 expands in a high-pressure t3 t3 t3 cylinder and t4 enters t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , torque variability can be reduced .
To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the bore , t1 t1 t1 t1 , are increased in low-pressure cylinders t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators , which are typically direct t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , steam turbines t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 , reciprocating Diesel engines , and gas turbines , have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion t1 t1 t1 .
The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine .
The cycle is an arrangement t0 t0 as t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , and utilizes the phase change of water t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 to provide a practical heat/power conversion system .
The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications .
t0 t0 t0 , Rankine steam cycles generated about 90 % of all electric power t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It is named t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
The historical measure of a steam engine 's energy efficiency was its " duty " .
The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Watt 's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design .
Early Watt engines t0 t0 t0 t0 improved this to 65 million .
t0 piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the " steam age " is continuing with energy levels t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The first commercial t0 device was a water pump , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It used condensing steam to create a vacuum t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 it used steam pressure t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Small engines were effective t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone t0 t0 t0 .
It received some use in mines , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost .
Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery 's construction t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century .
One engine was still known to be operating in 1820 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 ; Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802 .
These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , technological developments t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller , faster , t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines .
The company Energiprojekt AB t0 t0 has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam .
The efficiency of Energiprojekt 's steam engine reaches some 27-30 % on high-pressure engines .
It is a single-step , 5-cylinder engine t0 t0 t0 t0 with superheated steam and consumes approx. 4 kg t1 t1 t1 t1 of steam t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , steam turbines t1 t1 t1 use surface condensers as a cold sink .
The condensers are cooled by water flow t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The t0 t0 hot water output t1 t1 t1 is then put back into the boiler t2 t2 t2 .
A dry t0 cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Evaporative t0 t0 t0 cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
Such towers t0 have visible plumes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The governor could not actually hold a set speed , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The governor was able to handle smaller variations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Also , there was a tendency for oscillation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , engines equipped only with this governor t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The governor was improved over time t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 ; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it was popular in many other countries .
The t0 valve gears give events of fixed length t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Most however have a reversing mechanism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 ; t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine t0 t0 .
t0 t0 Thomas Savery patented a steam pump t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Savery 's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Thomas Newcomen 's atmospheric engine was the first t0 t0 steam engine t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors t0 t0 t0 t0 mounted on a drive shaft , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Steam acts upon these blades , producing rotary motion .
The stator consists of a similar , but fixed , series of blades t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam , giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages .
Turbines are only efficient t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 are usually connected to reduction gearing t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , turbines are directly connected to generators t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute t0 t0 t0 in the USA with 60 Hertz power , 3000 RPM t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 the turbines typically run at half these speeds , 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM .
A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Therefore , a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction .
The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines .
For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors .
t0 , most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement .
It is possible to use a mechanism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Many such engines have been designed , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year .
The other major method of producing O2 gas involves passing a stream of clean , dry air t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 , nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the operation of the two beds is interchanged , thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline .
This is known as pressure swing adsorption .
Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Oxygen gas can t0 be produced through electrolysis of water t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
DC electricity must be used : if AC is used , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the 2 : 1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A similar method is the electrocatalytic O2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids .
Chemical catalysts can be used as well , such as t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , to produce nearly pure O2 gas .
Oxygen , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars t1 t1 t1 .
Oxygen bars are establishments , t0 t0 t0 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Professional athletes , t0 t0 t0 t0 , also sometimes go off field t1 t1 to wear oxygen masks t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The pharmacological effect is doubtful ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O2 mixtures t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Hyperbaric t0 t0 t0 medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O2 t1 t1 t1 t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
Carbon monoxide poisoning , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 are sometimes treated using t2 t2 .
Increased O2 concentration t0 t0 t0 helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin .
Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Decompression sickness occurs in divers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Increasing the pressure of O2 t0 t0 t0 t0 is part of the treatment .
Uptake of O2 t0 t0 t0 is the essential purpose of respiration , so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine .
Treatment t0 t0 increases oxygen levels t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , oxygen forms chemical bonds t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 to give corresponding oxides .
The surface of most metals , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , are oxidized in the presence of air t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds , with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show .
t0 t0 , the mineral FeO t1 t1 t1 is written as Fe1 − xO , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
People t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 have supplemental O2 supplies .
Passengers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have an emergency supply of O2 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Pulling on the masks " to start the flow of oxygen " as cabin safety instructions dictate , forces iron filings t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction .
Oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers , which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas ; t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : alcohols t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t3 t3 t3 ; t4 t5 t5 t5 ; t6 t7 t7 t7 ; t8 t8 t9 t9 t9 ; t10 t11 t11 t11 ; t12 t12 t13 t13 t13 ; t14 t14 t15 t15 t15 t15 t15 t15 t15 .
There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen , t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
Acetone t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and phenol t1 t1 t1 are used as feeder materials t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are : glycerol , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
Epoxides are ethers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The element is found in almost all biomolecules t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 a t1 common complex biomolecules , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , contain no oxygen .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen .
All fats , fatty acids , t0 t0 , t0 t0 contain oxygen t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Oxygen also occurs in phosphate t0 t0 t0 groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Oxygen toxicity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving .
Prolonged breathing t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis .
Exposure t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 greater than 160 kPa t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 may lead to convulsions t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Acute oxygen toxicity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 % O2 at 66 m or more of depth ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Breathing pure O2 in space applications , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , causes no damage t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the O2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is , in general , about 30 kPa t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Oxygen gas t0 t0 t0 can be toxic at elevated partial pressures , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This is not a problem except for patients t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 – t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .

The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the price of oil had risen from US $ 3 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 ; t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The embargo caused an oil crisis , or " shock " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It was later called the " first oil shock " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 . t1
The crisis had a major impact t0 t0 t0 and created t1 rift within NATO .
Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants .
They arranged for Israel to pull back t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 , US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The promise of a negotiated settlement t0 t0 t0 t0 was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 , the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord .
The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Shortly thereafter , Britain followed , floating the pound sterling .
The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the industrialized nations increased their reserves t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 in amounts far greater than before .
The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations ' currencies .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , oil producers ' real income decreased .
t0 t0 t0 , OPEC issued a joint communiqué t1 that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold .
This contributed to the " Oil Shock " .
t0 t0 , OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities .
OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , launched a surprise attack on Israel , t3 t3 t3 .
This renewal of hostilities t0 t0 t0 t0 released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices .
t0 t0 t0 , Iran was the world 's second-largest oil exporter t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the Shah of Iran said in an interview : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Western nations increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It 's only fair t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Let 's say ten times more .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 , t3 , OPEC raised the posted price of oil t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 , oil ministers agreed to the embargo , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $ 2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
George Lenczowski notes , Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon 's eagerness t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 decision triggered a collective OPEC response .
Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States .
Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20 , t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , OAPEC proclaimed the embargo t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Much went for arms purchases t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973 .
The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
t0 , interest groups and government agencies t1 worried about energy were no match for Kissinger 's dominance .
In the US production , distribution and price disruptions " have been held responsible for recessions , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 . "
The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the price increases changed competitive positions t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 .
Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts .
The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Finding oil and developing new fields usually required t0 t0 ten years t1 t1 t1 .
The embargo was not uniform across Europe .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the Netherlands faced a complete embargo , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
His successor , Ted Heath , reversed this policy in 1970 , calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders .
Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo , the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own - a series of strikes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 became a major factor in the change of government .
Heath asked the British to heat only one room t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The UK , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 banned flying , driving and boating t1 t1 .
Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil .
The Netherlands imposed prison sentences t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Price controls exacerbated the crisis t0 t0 t0 .
The system limited the price of " old oil " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , old oil was withdrawn from the market , t1 t1 t1 .
The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies .
The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration .
Scarcity was addressed by rationing t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Motorists faced long lines at gas stations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office , a short-term organization created to coordinate the response t1 t1 t1 .
Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , lines at gasoline stations were common .
The American Automobile Association reported that in the last week of February 1974 , 20 % of American gasoline stations had no fuel .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act .
Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began in 1975 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The energy crisis led to greater interest t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
There is criticism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 providing t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a conversation t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 revealed Schlesinger had told him that " it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force . "
British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , intelligence warned " the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 . "
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71 % of its imported oil came from the Middle East t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 , the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a " nonfriendly " country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy .
It received a 5 % production cut in December , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , Japan issued a statement " asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 , Japan was considered an Arab-friendly state .
The USSR 's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , Saudi arms purchases t1 t1 t1 exceeded five times Israel 's .
Another motive t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 was the failure t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 to maintain control of Iran , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
Saudi Arabia , t0 t0 t0 t0 , is an Arab , t1 Sunni Muslim nation t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 . t3
The crisis reduced the demand t0 t0 t0 .
Japanese imports , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 had four cylinder engines t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 , t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .

t0 the American makers introduced their domestic replacements t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
An increase in imported cars t0 t0 t0 forced General Motors , Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models t1 t1 t1 .
The Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 had four-cylinder engines t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , the average American vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The improvements stayed even t0 the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $ 12 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Sales of large sedans t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis .
The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 became popular again in the mid-1970s .
The only full-size models t0 t0 t0 t0 were lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air , and Ford Galaxie 500 .
t0 smaller , t1 models t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 various other models sold well .
Federal safety standards , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT " downsize " revision of vehicle categories .
t0 t0 , GM 's t1 cars reflected the crisis .
t0 t0 , virtually all t1 t1 t1 American cars had shrunk , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

t0 , its t1 member nations were divided .
Saudi Arabia , trying to recover market share , increased production , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The world price , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 , decreased t4 t4 t4 to less than $ 10 t5 barrel .
t0 t0 t0 , oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels .
This " sale " price was a windfall for oil-importing nations , both developing and developed .
European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The three sources of European Union law are primary law , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The main sources of primary law are the Treaties t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Secondary sources include regulations and directives t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .

t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , like every political body it has laws which " constitute " its basic governance structure .
The EU 's primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union t0 t0 t0 and the Treaty t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .

The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states , as well as certain islands and overseas territories , including Madeira , the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments .
European Union law also applies in territories t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The TEU specifically excludes certain regions , t0 t0 the Faroe Islands , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force , t0 t0 t0 , and are generally concluded for an unlimited period .

Minor amendments were made t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 , more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties , t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 , t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 , t5 , t5 , t5 , t5 , t5 , t5 , t5 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 .
Greenland signed a Treaty in 1985 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Following the Nice Treaty , there was an attempt t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force .
Instead , the Lisbon Treaty was enacted .
Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty , but it was t0 an amending treaty , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 – t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union .
Article 17 t0 t0 t0 of the Treaty t1 t1 t1 states t2 t2 should " promote the general interest of the Union " while Article 17 t3 t3 t3 adds that Commissioners should be " completely independent " t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 Union legislative acts may t3 be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 . t5
This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
The Commission 's President t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 sets the agenda t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Commissioners t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are bargained over intensively by the member states .
The Commissioners , t0 t0 t0 , are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The proposal t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 Parliament , was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon .
This means Commissioners are , through the appointment process , the t0 subordinates t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Commissioners have various privileges , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , and having immunity t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Commissioners have t0 been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This resulted in one main case , Commission v Edith Cresson t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had even the slightest sense of responsibility .
This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office .
t0 t0 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner t1 t1 , John Dalli , who quickly resigned t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 , the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The second main legislative body is the Council , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The heads of government of member states t0 convene a " European Council " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 .
It meets each six months t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , but it does not itself ' legislative functions ' .
The Council does this : t0 t0 t1 is the governments t2 t2 t2 t2 , but there will be a different minister at each meeting , depending on the topic discussed t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The minister must have the authority t0 t0 and bin the member states in decisions .
When voting takes place t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 are not dominated by larger member states .
t0 t0 there are 352 t1 , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , t2 t2 t2 .
TEU article 16 t0 t0 t0 and TFEU article 238 t1 t1 t1 define this to mean at least 55 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 : t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
This is critical t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , TFEU article 294 defines the " ordinary legislative procedure " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The essence is there are three readings , starting with a Commission proposal , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a " Conciliation Committee " is convened , representing MEPs , ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement t1 t1 t1 t1 : t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 : it is harder to change EU law than stay the same .
A different procedure exists for budgets .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , authorisation must be given by the Council .
Member state governments should be informed by the Commission t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The EU t0 t0 t0 can only act within its power t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
TEU articles 4 and 5 state t0 powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 believe they decide , other member state Parliaments t1 they decide , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 the Court of Justice of the European Union t1 t1 t1 is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher European Court of Justice t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 that deals with cases t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 there is one judge from each member state , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
A president is elected by the judges t0 t0 t0 .
Under TEU article 19 t0 t0 t0 is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law .
t0 t0 , most EU law is applied by member state courts t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The CJEU 's duty is to " ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments , including Van Gend en Loos , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems .
This has meant t0 the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Court of Justice 's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law , then EU law has primacy .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , Costa v ENEL , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , Costa had no claim .
t0 t0 , the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim , not Mr Costa .
t0 , t1 t1 , Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Court of Justice , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 member states " albeit within limited spheres , have restricted their sovereign rights t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 " t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
EU law would not " be overridden by domestic legal provisions , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 . "
This meant any " subsequent unilateral act " of the member state inapplicable .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a company , t2 t2 , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 said the Court of Justice , the t3 t3 applicable measures t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law t6 .
This was necessary to prevent a " corresponding denial " of Treaty " obligations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " , that could " imperil the very foundations of the " EU .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the basic principle is that Parliament , as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy , can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law .
This , however , would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It was held in R t0 t0 t0 t0 v Secretary of State for Transport t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 that UK courts have a duty " to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 . "
t0 t0 the UK Supreme Court noted that in R t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 v Secretary of State for Transport , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , there could be " fundamental principles " of common law , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 then it can not override German law .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , it would not review EU legislation t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 member states have expressed similar reservations .
This suggests the EU 's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states , its factual commitment t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law .
Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or " standing " t0 t0 t0 t0 to bring claims t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t1 t1 , citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These rules t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law .
All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The remedy for a claimant t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 is often monetary damages , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : that is , not all EU laws have " direct effect " .
In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are directly effective , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Van Gend en Loos , a postal company , claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities t0 t0 , when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not " expressly " confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims , they could do so .
Historically , international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims t0 t0 t0 , but the Court of Justice proclaimed " the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law " .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , Van Gend en Loos could recover the money t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties , both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions .
" Regulations , " held the Court of Justice , " come into force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 . t2
t0 t0 t0 t0 , some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Directives do not generally give citizens t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 standing to sue other citizens .
t0 t0 , this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually " leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods " t1 t1 .
In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards , leaving member states to apply higher standards .
t0 t0 , the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Directives do not have so called " horizontal " direct effect t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This view was instantly controversial , and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens .
The Court of Justice refused , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the member state can not enforce conflicting laws , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti 's solvent and varnish business .
A member state could " not rely , as against individuals , on its own failure t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 . "
t0 , a citizen or company can invoke a Directive , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 , in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , it can be invoked between private non-state parties t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
This follows from t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive .
The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it can t2 be bound by Directives .
In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer , British Gas plc , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 .
Textbooks t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 often called this " indirect effect " .
In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA the Court of Justice held that a Spanish Court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions , on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors , to conform with the First Company Law Directive article 11 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation can not contradict plain words in a national statute .
t0 , t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a citizen may not be able to bring claims t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Francovich , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals , and there is a causal link between a member state 's violation of EU and a claimant 's loss , damages must be paid .
The fact t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is no defence .
The principles of European Union law are rules of law t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the courts have drawn on a variety of sources , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Accepted general principles of European Union Law include fundamental rights t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the least onerous must be adopted , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The principle of proportionality is also recognised in Article 5 of the EC Treaty , stating that " any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty " .
The concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice t0 t0 t0 .
It is an important general principle of international law and public law , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain , in that it is clear and precise , and its legal implications foreseeable , specially when applied to financial obligations .
The adoption of laws t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 must have a proper legal basis .
Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws , i.e. laws should not take effect t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The doctrine of legitimate expectation , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that " those who act in good faith t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 should not be frustrated in their expectations " .
Fundamental rights , t0 t0 t0 t0 , were first recognised by the European Court of Justice t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 such the European Court of Justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , the European Court of Justice can not uphold measures t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The European Court of Justice also found that " international treaties for the protection of human rights t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , can supply guidelines t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 . "
None of the original treaties t0 t0 t0 t0 mention protection t1 t1 t1 .
It was not envisaged for European Union measures , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights , hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights .
The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of fundamental rights t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The 2007 Lisbon Treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in Article 6 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 . t6
t0 , the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become an integral part of European Union law , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , after the Lisbon Treaty , the Charter and the Convention now co-exist under European Union law , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 .
The Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The basis for the Social Chapter was developed in 1989 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A t0 down version was adopted as the Social Charter t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Social Charter declares 30 general principles , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Social Charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The UK refused to sign the Social Charter t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The UK t0 was the t1 t1 state to veto the Social Charter being t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , an Agreement on Social Policy was added as a protocol .
t0 , the UK was exempt from legislation t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The protocol was to become known as " Social Chapter " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 the Agreement on Social Policy the European Union was to " support and complement " the policies of member states .
The aims of the Agreement t0 t0 Policy are .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 , the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The UK t0 adopted the main legislation t1 t1 t1 the Agreement on Social Policy , the 1994 Works Council Directive , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 Social Chapter the European Union has undertaken policy initiatives in various social policy areas , including labour and industry relations , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community t0 t0 t0 agreement t1 t1 , t2 , t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war .
Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
This was the first time t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome , also known as the EC Treaty , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 .
The two t0 provisions on EU competition law t1 t1 were established in article 85 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The treaty also established principles on competition law t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time .
t0 , the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 any such agreements are automatically void .
Article 101 t0 t0 t0 establishes exemptions , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , gives consumers a " fair share " of the benefit t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The general test is whether a concentration t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 with a community dimension t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 might significantly impede effective competition .
Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state 's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , free movement and trade were central to European development t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , two countries can both benefit from trade t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , breaking down barriers to trade , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 , is meant to reduce consumer prices .
It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , however , those stages were considerably mixed , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 .
In practice free trade , without standards to ensure fair trade , can benefit some people and groups within countries t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 , t3 , t3 t3 , t3 t3 , t3 t3 .
The Treaty t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
These so-called " four freedoms " were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers t0 t0 t0 t0 , technical barriers t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 and fiscal barriers t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit .
The Treaties limit free trade , to prioritise other values t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 the Court of Justice has taken the view t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Free movement of goods t0 t0 t0 t0 is achieved by a customs union , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The EU manages imports from non-member states , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States ' .
In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all " trading rules " that are " enacted by Member States " which could hinder trade " directly or indirectly , actually or potentially " would be caught by article 34 .
This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful .
It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville , who could not get certificates t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This " wide test " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
It also means states can be responsible for private actors .
t0 t0 , t1 Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ' manifestly t0 t0 t0 ' t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 it must be justified under article 36 .
The justifications include public morality , policy or security , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 . t2
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules .
t0 , in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ' fundamental pillars of a democratic society ' , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately .
This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and t0 t0 t0 be suitable to achieve the aim , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 rules apply to all goods neutrally , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
For t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 : t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 , t6 t6 t6 , t6 t6 , t6 t7 t7 , t8 t8 : t9 t9 are not closed .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol .
The Court of Justice rejected the German government 's arguments t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought .
This rule primarily applies to requirements t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages t0 t0 t0 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection .
The argument t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was disproportionate : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Commission v Italy Italian law required t1 cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as " chocolate " .
It had to be " chocolate substitute " .
All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They claimed the law infringed article 34 .
The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a " chocolate substitute " label .
This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes .
A ' neutral and objective statement ' was enough to protect consumers .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , this can also infringe article 34 .
t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 .
t0 , the law applied neutrally to everyone , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This was not a product requirement , but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
It would require justification t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Court of Justice developed a presumption that " selling arrangements " would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , was unlawful .
The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition , not to hinder trade .
The Court of Justice held , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 selling arrangement t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were " the only effective form of promotion enabling t2 t2 t2 t2 to penetrate " the market .
In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio , TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 , states have to give mutual recognition to each other 's standards of regulation , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory " race to the bottom " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the European Community t1 focused upon free movement of workers : t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 , this focus shifted towards developing a more " social " Europe .
Free movement was increasingly based on " citizenship " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
This means the basic " worker " rights t0 t0 t0 45 function t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 18 to 21 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a " worker " is anybody who is economically active , which includes everyone t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
A job , t0 , need not be paid in money t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an " indirect quid pro quo " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Having " worker " status means protection against all forms of discrimination t0 t0 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 a citizen , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , has rights to seek work , t4 in local and European elections , t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
t0 t0 , free movement has become politically contentious t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Nevertheless , practically " all available research finds little impact " of " labour mobility t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " .
The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
First , articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment , conclude contracts , and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Belgian Football Association v Bosman , a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Court of Justice held " the transfer rules constitute t0 t0 t0 an obstacle to free movement " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 a bank t2 Bolzano , Italy , was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Court of Justice , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Second , article 7 t0 t0 t0 requires equal treatment t1 t1 t1 t1 .
In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 to a man t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel 's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement .
Although the tax was " likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , people must receive equal treatment regarding " social advantages " , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Conversely , in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman t0 t0 t0 t0 , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany , did not have a right to receive German child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45 t1 t1 t1 are t2 t2 policy , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 .
Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a " fundamental " status of member state nationals t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Court has required that higher education , along with other forms of vocational training , should be more access , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
In Commission v Austria the Court held that Austria was not entitled to restrict places in Austrian universities to Austrian students to avoid " structural , staffing and financial problems " if t0 t0 t0 t0 foreign students applied for places t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , the Treaty t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 also protects the " freedom of establishment " t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 dell ' Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be " established " means to participate in economic life " on a stable and continuous basis " , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
All people or entities that engage in economic activity , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions .
The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment , so article 49 has both " vertical " and " horizontal " direct effect .
In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others ' freedom of establishment t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 was not a restriction .
The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market .
t0 , there was no prima facie infringement freedom t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , a toxic waste spill t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste .
Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that " Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union " .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , Franco t3 , t3 t3 , t3 t3 Security Commissioner , proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for " ecological crimes " .
The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
That ruling set a precedent that the Commission , on a supranational basis , may legislate in criminal law – t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the t1 t1 proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive .
Motions were tabled in the European Parliament t0 t0 t0 on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 , the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be , only that there must be some .
The " freedom to provide services " under TFEU article 56 applies to people t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Health care generally counts as a service .
In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany .
The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 the Court of Justice held health was a " service " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients t0 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal .
Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , fell outside article 56 altogether .
The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 sold commodities futures t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 attempted to challenge a Dutch law t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent " undesirable developments in securities trading " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 a " laserdrome " business was banned by the Bonn council .
It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity , t0 t0 t0 t0 , did count as a justified restriction on freedom t1 t1 t1 .
In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The ban was proportionate t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed .
t0 t0 t1 t1 , the Court of Justice held in R t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing TFEU article 49 .
This meant the Daily Mail newspaper 's t0 company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills t1 t1 t1 .
The UK did not need to justify its action , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark 's minimum share capital rules .
UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Court of Justice held that Denmark 's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : it was an " outright negation " of the right of establishment .
t0 , t0 t0 t0 és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
The Amazon rainforest t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , is a moist broadleaf forest t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This region includes territory t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 , t4 , t4 , t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
States t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 contain " Amazonas " in their names .
The Amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 the t1 t1 t1 , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent .
t0 t0 t0 , the rainforest extended as far south as 45° .
Climate fluctuations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band .
It expanded again t0 t0 t0 t0 , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum .
t0 , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch .
Water t0 t0 t0 t0 flowed toward the Atlantic , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum t0 t0 t0 and subsequent deglaciation .
Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
There is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was .
Some t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This debate has proved difficult to resolve t0 t0 t0 t0 of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown t2 t2 t2 t2 each year , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , then t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 , 27.7 million tons t8 t8 t8 t8 of dust fall over the Amazon basin , 132 million tons of dust remain in the air , 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea , t9 t9 t9 t9 t9 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent t0 t0 t0 , t1 described in her book Amazonia : t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre t0 t0 t0 t0 is the maximum t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
However , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated .
Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 the population had fallen to 1 million t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The first European t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was Francisco de Orellana in 1542 .
The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana , rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s .
It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe , such as smallpox .
t0 t0 t0 , numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest , rather than being a pristine wilderness , has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta .
Terra preta t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management .
The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
In the region of the Xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Among those were evidence of roads , bridges and large plazas .
The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , at least 40,000 plant species , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 have been scientifically classified in the region .
One t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 live in the rainforests of the Amazon , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone .
The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A study t0 t0 found one square kilometer t1 t1 t1 t1 of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants .
The t0 plant biomass is estimated at 356 ± 47 tonnes t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The total number of tree species t0 t0 t0 is estimated at 16,000 .
The rainforest contains several species t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are the black caiman , jaguar , cougar , and anaconda .
t0 t0 t0 , electric eels can produce an electric shock t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh .
There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors .
Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Malaria , t0 t0 t0 Dengue fever can t1 be contracted in the Amazon region .
Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas t0 t0 t0 .
The main sources of deforestation t0 t0 t0 are human settlement t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , access to the forest 's interior was highly restricted , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Farms established t0 t0 t0 were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method .
However , the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion .
The soils t0 t0 t0 are productive for just a short period of time , so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land .
These farming practices led to deforestation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Deforestation is considerable , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the total area of forest lost in the Amazon t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , is used for livestock pasture .
t0 , Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans t1 t1 t1 t1 .
New research however , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , there has been no economical advantage for Brazil t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The first two highways t0 opened up the rainforest t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 annual deforestation rate t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 was 18 % higher than in the previous five years t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , there has been an increase to the present day .
Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10 % of the world 's terrestrial primary productivity and 10 % of the carbon stores t0 t0 — t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
One computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 , simulations of Amazon basin climate change t1 t1 t1 t1 are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 continue to disappear , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , the relationship t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 has gained increased attention , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The use of remote sensing t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is t1 being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , members of the Trio Tribe , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims .
t0 , most tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the classification of tree growth stages t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 is crucial .
t0 t0 Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon t1 t1 t1 : t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
The researcher used a combination of Synthetic aperture radar t0 t0 t0 and Thematic Mapper t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought .
Scientists t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 argue in the article that this drought response , coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate , are pushing the rainforest towards a " tipping point " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert , with catastrophic consequences for the world 's climate .
t0 t0 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought , in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought .
The affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles t0 t0 t0 t0 of rainforest , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The findings were published in the journal Science .
t0 t0 t0 t0 the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide ; t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Ctenophora t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is a phylum of animals t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Their t0 t0 feature is the ' combs ' – t1 t1 t1 which they use for swimming – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Adults of various species range from a few millimeters t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Like cnidarians , their bodies consist of a mass of jelly , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , these layers are two cells deep , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla .
Almost all ctenophores are predators , taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 , ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day .
Only 100–150 species have been validated , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The phylum has a wide range of body forms , including the flattened , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 tentacles and prey t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Most species are hermaphrodites — t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Others are sequential hermaphrodites , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Fertilization is generally external , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The young are generally planktonic t0 t0 t0 t0 look like miniature cydippids , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The exceptions are the beroids , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and the platyctenids , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , juveniles are capable of reproduction t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate .
Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , predation t2 t2 may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
One ctenophore , Mnemiopsis , has t0 been introduced into the Black Sea , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The situation was aggravated by other factors , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Despite their soft , gelatinous bodies , fossils thought to represent ctenophores , apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms , have been found in lagerstätten t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , about 515 million years ago .
The position of the ctenophores t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , and the majority view t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores .
A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like , and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently , probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago .
Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the " cydippids " are not monophyletic , t0 t0 t0 do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Ctenophores form an animal phylum t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , both ctenophores and cnidarians have : cells t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 ; t3 t3 ; t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , ctenophores have two main layers of cells t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 ; t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic , along with sponges .
t0 ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Most species have eight strips , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The name " ctenophora " means " comb-bearing " , from the Greek κτείς t0 t0 t0 t0 meaning " comb " and the Greek suffix -φορος meaning " carrying " .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , ctenophores have a wide range of body plans .
Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 oceanic species do not preserve well , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The t0 cavity forms : a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles ; t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 ; t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 : t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 ; t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 ; t5 four branches round the sensory complex at the far end t6 t6 t6 – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores .
The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium , the gastrodermis .
The mouth and pharynx have t0 cilia t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles t0 t0 t0 t0 , germ cells t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The outer surface bears t0 eight comb rows , called swimming-plates , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 .
The " combs " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 run across each row , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Unlike conventional cilia and flagella , which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern , t0 cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy , but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities .
Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the ciliary rosettes t1 t1 t1 t1 may pump this into the mesoglea t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 t0 sensory feature is the aboral organ t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Its main component is a statocyst , a balance sensor t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , that sense its orientation .
The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long , t0 t0 .
A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers .
t0 its response is determined by the animal 's " mood " , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it will often put some comb rows into reverse , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Cydippid ctenophores have bodies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 extends a pair of long , slender tentacles , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 ; t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t9 t9 t9 t9 t9 t9 t9 .
The function of the spiral thread is uncertain , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
In addition t0 t0 , members of the genus Haeckelia , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies t2 t2 .
The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : they may flick out very quickly t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 ; t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
There are eight rows of combs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The " combs " beat in a metachronal rhythm t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 a ciliary groove runs out under the dome t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Lobata have a pair of lobes , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 .
This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey .
Lobates have eight comb-rows , originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
Most lobates are quite passive t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Beroida , t0 t0 t0 t0 , have no feeding appendages , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to " bite " off pieces of prey t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 – t0 t0 t0 t0 .
In front of the field of macrocilia , on the mouth " lips " in some species of Beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Cestida t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
There is a pair t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and tentilla t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
There are two known species , with worldwide distribution t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 : Cestum veneris t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 is among the largest ctenophores – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Velamen parallelum , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , can move much faster in what has been described as a " darting motion " .
Most Platyctenida have oval bodies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
They cling to and creep on surfaces t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
All but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows .
Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Almost all species are hermaphrodites , in other words they function as both males and females at the same time – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Fertilization is external in most species , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile .
Development of the fertilized eggs is direct , t0 t0 t0 there is no distinctive larval t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths .
t0 t0 t0 the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , they produce secretions t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores ' bioluminescence t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ' t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Almost all ctenophores are predators – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , they can eat 10 times their own weight per day .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , other t1 species prey on zooplankton t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t4 , t4 t4 t4 .
Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts t0 t0 t0 t0 into their own tentacles t1 t1 t1 .
Ctenophores have been compared to spiders t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The two-tentacled " cydippid " Lampea feeds exclusively on salps , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Members of the t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : Pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Ctenophores used to be regarded as " dead ends " in marine food chains t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Detailed investigation of chum salmon , t0 t0 , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Beroids prey t0 on other ctenophores .
Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Since t0 t0 t0 t0 have large seasonal variations t1 t1 , most fish that prey on them are generalists , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities .
The impact was increased by chronic overfishing , and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost , causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Mnemiopsis populations t0 t0 t0 were eventually brought under control t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 the abundance of plankton t1 t1 t1 seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough t0 t0 were known , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , from the early Devonian t2 t2 t2 period .
Three t0 putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
All three t0 lacked tentacles t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything t0 t0 t0 t0 .
One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 – t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly .
The t0 t0 t0 t0 fossil Stromatoveris , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period .
De-Gan Shu , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia , used for filter feeding .
They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary " aunt " of ctenophores , and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system .
The relationship of ctenophores t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity .
It has been the focus of debate t0 t0 t0 .
Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A series of studies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 showed evidence congruent t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 are either sister t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage .
However , other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and that Porifera t1 t1 t1 is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead .
Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles .
Richard Harbison 's purely morphological analysis t0 t0 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids .
He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like .
A molecular phylogeny analysis t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like .
It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Fresno t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , is a city in the U.S. state of California .
t0 t0 t0 , the city 's population was 520,159 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Fresno is in the center of the San Joaquin Valley and is the largest city in the Central Valley , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It is approximately 220 miles t0 t0 t0 t0 northwest of Los Angeles , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The name Fresno means " ash tree " in Spanish , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .

Many Millerton residents , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , moved to the new community .
Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885 .
t0 t0 the Fresno Traction Company operated 47 streetcars t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The new concept found little resonance among network implementers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm , circuit switching , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 , t5 , t5 t5 .
Packet mode communication may be implemented with t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme .
Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale , t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
The work focuses on three key ideas : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , Donald Davies t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t2 developed the same message routing methodology t3 t3 t3 t3 .
He called it packet switching , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A member of Davies ' team t0 t0 t0 t0 met Lawrence Roberts at the 1967 ACM Symposium t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 in the ARPANET .
t0 t0 t0 each packet includes complete addressing information .
The packets are routed individually , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Each packet is labeled with a destination address , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet .
This precludes the need t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , but means that much more information is needed in the packet header , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 ; potentially , the system has to do as much work t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 , the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 a virtual connection , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The packets include a connection identifier t0 t0 t0 t0 and are negotiated between endpoints t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Address information is only transferred to each node t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters .
Acceptable values t0 t0 t0 may be negotiated .
Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id t0 t0 t0 .
The packet header can be small , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations .
But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model .
Frame Relay does it at level two , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes .
X.25 does not define any operations t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It only operates at the user-network-interface t0 t0 t0 .
Thus , the network provider is free to use any procedure t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Frame Relay is a modified version t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link , t1 t1 .
Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols .
The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Some implementations used X.25 within the network t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model .
t0 , its address field t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 can be used at the OSI network layer , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , it rids itself t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , but still has the DLCI as an ID t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 it does not define internal network routing operations .
t0 t0 its packet IDs , the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses .
The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI .
How this is done is up to the network provider .
Frame Relay , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is connection-oriented at layer two , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks .
t0 , X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS .
ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , about twenty different network technologies had been developed .
Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets .
The User Datagram Protocol t0 t0 t0 is an example t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data t1 t1 t1 .
This results in a simpler host interface t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type .

t0 t0 t0 t0 , it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture .
DECnet is a suite of network protocols t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures , thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it later t1 t1 t1 evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol .
The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation .

t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a data network t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 was designed to connect GE 's four computer sales and service centers t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 to facilitate a computer time-sharing service , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the centers were computer service bureaus , offering batch processing services .
They lost money from the beginning , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
He decided that a time-sharing system , based on Kemney 's work at Dartmouth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , could be profitable .
Warner was right .
Merit Network , Inc. , an independent non-profit 501 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 corporation t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was formed in 1966 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 as a means t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 connections to the CDC mainframe t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 completed the triad .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , host to host batch connections t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , interactive file transfer , gateways t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , X.25 host attachments , gateways t5 t5 t5 t5 , Ethernet attached hosts , and eventually TCP/IP and additional public universities t6 t6 join the network .
All of this set the stage for Merit 's role in the NSFNET project t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States .
It was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
He had tried to interest AT & T in buying the technology , but the monopoly 's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future .
Bolt , Beranack and Newman t0 t0 t0 provided the financing .
It t0 used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface t1 t1 .
Telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the CCITT .
Telenet was incorporated in 1973 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE .
Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .

t0 t0 : Tymnet was not named after Mr. Tyme .
Another employee suggested the name .
There were two kinds of X.25 networks .
Some t0 t0 t0 t0 TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface .
Some older networks t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes .
DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

The vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48c t0 t0 t0 t0 IP links t1 t1 t1 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48c .
The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of Central Asia , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60 % of Europe 's total population .
t0 t0 , the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The world population t0 t0 t0 did not recover to pre-plague levels t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The plague recurred occasionally in Europe t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The plague disease , t0 t0 t0 t0 , is enzootic t1 t1 t1 t1 in populations of fleas t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 , t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Nestorian graves t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have inscriptions referring to plague t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China .
In China , the t0 t0 Mongol conquest caused a decline t1 t1 t1 t1 .
However , economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century .
t0 t0 t0 a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Epidemics t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Genoese traders fled , taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is clear that several existing conditions such as war , famine , and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death .
t0 t0 , the disease spread northwest across Europe , t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It was introduced in Norway t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 it spread to northwestern Russia t1 t1 .
The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The plague struck various countries in the Middle East t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the disease entered the region from southern Russia t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , the disease travelled eastward to Gaza , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the disease reached Antioch .
The city 's residents fled to the north , t0 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Gasquet t0 t0 t0 claimed that the Latin name atra mors t1 t1 t1 t1 for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I. Pontanus t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , they called it the black death .
The name spread through Scandinavia t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death .
Medical knowledge had stagnated t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The t0 t0 account t1 t1 t1 came from the medical faculty in Paris t2 t2 t2 to the king of France that blamed the heavens , in the form of a conjunction of three planets t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory .
Today , this is known as the Miasma theory .
The word ' plague ' had no special significance at this time , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The t0 explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the fleas move on to other hosts , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the ' Great Pestilence ' t0 t0 and suggested that " it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague " .
He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists .
The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75 % and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , 80 percent die within eight days .
Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 t0 t0 t0 .
Symptoms include fever , cough , and blood-tinged sputum .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , sputum becomes free flowing and bright red .
Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Symptoms are high fevers t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades t0 t0 t0 t0 of the Y. pestis genome t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These clades t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 were found to be ancestral t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 the plague may have entered Europe in two waves .
Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 .
Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The results of the Haensch study have t0 been confirmed t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 . t2
A study t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 sequenced the genome of Y. pestis from plague victims t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures t0 t0 t0 .
In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 ; t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 ; t5 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 t5 struck urban and rural areas ; t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t9 t9 t9 t9 t9 t9 , t10 t10 t10 t10 t10 — t11 t11 t11 t11 t11 t11 t12 t12 t12 .
A variety of alternatives t0 t0 t0 t0 have been put t1 .
Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats ; t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
However , no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases , including typhus , smallpox and respiratory infections .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , others point to additional septicemic t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 and pneumonic t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 forms of the plague , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , scientists t1 t1 t1 t1 announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The t0 t0 t0 estimate for the Middle East , including Iraq , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , is for a death rate of about a third .
The Black Death killed about 40 % of Egypt 's population .
Half of Paris 's population of 100,000 people died .
In Italy , the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120 thousand inhabitants t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
At least 60 % of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits t1 t1 t1 t1 to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit t2 t2 t2 found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , the plague spread t1 rapidly t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , about a third of the European population had already perished .
t0 t0 t0 , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 % of the population to die .
The disease bypassed some areas , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Monks and priests were especially hard hit t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries .
t0 t0 t0 , the plague was present somewhere in Europe t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Second Pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years : t0 t0 t0 ; t1 ; t2 ; t3 ; t4 ; t5 ; t6 ; t7 ; t8 ; t9 ; t10 ; t11 ; t12 ; t13 ; t14 ; t15 t15 .
Subsequent outbreaks , though severe , marked the retreat t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
There are three major types of rock : t0 , t0 , t0 t0 .
The rock cycle is an important concept in geology t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it is an igneous rock .
This rock can be weathered and eroded , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and is then weathered , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 , a new magma is formed , from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , showed that the Earth 's lithosphere , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , is separated into a number of tectonic plates t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 , t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
There is an intimate coupling between t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 : oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This coupling t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics .
The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries .
Mid-ocean ridges , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart .
Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Transform boundaries , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes .
Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
They t0 provided a driving force for crustal deformation , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle .
Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves t0 t0 to image the interior of the Earth .
t0 advances t1 t1 t1 showed the existence of a liquid outer core t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 and a dense solid inner core .
These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The following four timelines show the geologic time scale .
The first shows the entire time t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , but this compresses the most recent eon .
Therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The second scale compresses the most recent era , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is further expanded in the fourth scale .
The second , third , and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Holocene t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Pleistocene t0 t0 t0 epoch .
Q stands for the Quaternary period .
The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
Finding the key bed t0 t0 t0 may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault .
The principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , then the inclusions must be older than the formation t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A similar situation t0 t0 t0 occurs when xenoliths are found .
These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , xenoliths are older than the rock t1 t1 t1 .
The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , their presence or t2 t2 t2 absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought .
The principle becomes quite complex , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods .
This changed the understanding of geologic time .
t0 , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
For many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies .
Common methods include uranium-lead dating , potassium-argon dating , argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating .
These methods are used for a variety of applications .
Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement .
Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they shorten and become thicker .
Because rock units , other than muds , do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways : t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , thrust faults form , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Because deeper rock is often older , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones .
Movement t0 t0 can result in folding , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , rocks behave plastically , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These folds can either be those where the material t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 where it buckles downwards , creating " synforms " .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they are called anticlines and synclines , t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
Extension causes the rock units t0 t0 t0 to become longer t1 t1 .
This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Normal faults drop rock units t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This typically results in younger units being t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Stretching of units can result in their t0 ; t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Rocks t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 are often also metamorphosed .
These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The addition of new rock units , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 occurs during deformation .
Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These sediments are deposited on the rock unit t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 motion t1 t1 t1 maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity .
Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Dikes , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , enter along cracks , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Hawaiian Islands , t0 t0 , consist t1 entirely of layered basaltic lava flows .
The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Other areas are much more geologically complex .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , sedimentary , t1 , t1 t1 rocks have been metamorphosed , t2 , t2 , t2 t2 .
Even older rocks , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 have been metamorphosed to the point t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , these processes can occur in stages .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area .
Geologists use a number of field , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 to decipher Earth history and understand the processes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , geologists use primary information related to petrology t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , geologists also study modern soils , rivers , landscapes , and glaciers ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory .
Two of the primary methods t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units .
Petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
They t0 plot and combine measurements of geological structures t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This helps to show the relationship t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Stratigraphers t0 analyze data from geophysical surveys t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .

Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Some modern scholars , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , are t1 t1 t1 that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni t0 t0 t0 t0 was one of the earliest Persian geologists , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

How shall he ever know t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Other civil disobedients t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
And t0 other civil disobedients , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty .
There is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience .
ACT-UP 's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient t0 t0 t0 is essentially stating , t1 , I committed the act t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 , I am proud of it .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; I am guilty as charged , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Guilt implies wrong-doing .
I feel I have done no wrong .
I may have violated some specific laws , but I am guilty of doing no wrong .
I therefore plead not guilty .
A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise t0 t0 t0 .
One defendant t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , stated , " I plead for the beauty t2 t2 t2 " ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , one at a time they stepped across the " line " and were immediately arrested .
They were put on a bus t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 .
A t0 t0 civil rights attorney , t1 t1 , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The arrested persons were found " guilty , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Howard Zinn writes , t0 may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 that is different than the notion that they must go to jail t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 connected with civil disobedience .
The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
To accept jail penitently t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest .
t0 t0 , the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated .
Some t0 disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 U.S. Navy property argued to the court t4 t4 that " the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy " .
t0 t0 t0 , the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days .
This action was upheld t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment t0 t0 t0 .
Steven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , " they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 . "
A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Chicago Eight used a political defense , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , some civil disobedients seek jury nullification .
t0 t0 t0 , this t1 been made more difficult by court decisions t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification .
One theory is t0 , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Therefore , conscientious lawbreakers must be punished .
Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law , and then wins his case , then that act did not constitute civil disobedience .
It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , is not civil disobedience .
t0 , a protestor t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : " Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 . "
During t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; the courts ruled it was a political question .
The necessity defense has t0 been used as a shadow defense t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 , court cases t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 , many of them have escaped prosecution t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 . t4
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , achieving crime control t1 t1 t1 deterrence is a major goal t2 t2 t2 .
Brownlee argues , " Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 . "
Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes , In deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good .
This means that the objector has no right not to be punished .
It is a matter for the state t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 to decide on utilitarian grounds t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure .
Construction differs from manufacturing t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Construction t0 t0 industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries .
Construction starts with planning , design , and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use .
Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines .
An architect t0 manages the job , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , effective planning is essential .
Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 .
The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects .
t0 t0 , there are three sectors of construction : t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
Building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential t0 t0 t0 .
Infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It includes large public works , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Industrial includes refineries , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
There are other ways t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Engineering News-Record t0 t0 t0 is a trade magazine for the construction industry .
t0 t0 , ENR compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies .
They publish a list of the largest companies in the United States t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 firms t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , ENR compiled the data in nine market segments .
It was divided as transportation , petroleum , buildings , power , industrial , water , manufacturing , sewer/waste , telecom , hazardous waste plus a tenth category t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , they used data on transportation , t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 to rank firms as heavy contractors .
The Standard Industrial Classification t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have a classification system t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
To recognize the differences of companies t0 t0 t0 , it is divided into three subsectors : t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
There are also categories for construction service firms t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and construction managers t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings .
The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom .
Often , the owner of the property acts t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , those t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Residential construction practices , t0 , t0 t0 must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice .
Materials t0 available t1 t1 t1 t2 dictate the construction materials used t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Cost of construction t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 basis t2 t2 can vary dramatically based on site conditions , t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , careful planning again is needed here .
New techniques of building construction are being researched , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 of building material per hour t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars 's t1 t1 t1 building is scheduled to be built in 2014 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality .
A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts .
The design t0 consists of drawings and specifications , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
The design team is most commonly employed by t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 the property owner .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the owner t1 awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder .
The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , architects , t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 were more likely to be entirely separate companies , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , a firm t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 may have experts t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 , each such firm may offer itself as " one-stop shopping " t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This is designated as a " design build " contract t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems .
Underbids happen t0 builders ask for too little money t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Cash flow problems exist t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Fraud is a problem in many fields , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Mortgage bankers , t0 , t0 t0 t0 are likely participants in creating an overall plan t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Cost overruns with government projects have occurred t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements .
Constructing a project t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 does not benefit the owner .
Some legal requirements come from malum t0 t0 t0 , or the desire t1 t1 t1 that are indisputably bad – t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
An attorney may seek changes or exemptions t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The time element in construction means that a delay costs money , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the delay can be extremely expensive .
Thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations t0 t0 .
Contracts t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering t0 t0 t0 aka private finance initiatives t1 t1 t1 and alliances such as " pure " or " project " alliances and " impure " or " strategic " alliances .
The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This is the most common method of construction procurement t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator .
His or her role is to design the works , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
There are direct contractual links between the architect 's client and the main contractor .
Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy .
The owner produces a list of requirements for a project , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Several D & B contractors present different ideas t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The owner selects the ideas t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , it is not just one contractor , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they begin building the first phase of the project .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they design phase 2 .
This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , an occupancy permit may be issued .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the industry in 2014 has around $ 960 billion in annual revenue t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , there were about 667,000 firms t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , the industry employed an estimated 5.8 million as of April 2013 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , approximately 828,000 women were employed in the construction industry t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry , such as the Middle East , yield higher average salaries than in the UK for example .
The average earning for a professional in the construction industry t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , job types and levels of experience , is £42,090 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This trend is t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 that more affluent roles are available , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Some construction workers t0 t0 t0 have made more than $ 100,000 annually , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers t1 t1 t1 t1 was nearly three times t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries t0 t0 t0 .
Proper safety equipment t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 can curtail the risk of occupational injuries t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Other major causes of fatalities t0 t0 t0 t0 include electrocution , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
Private schools , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , are not t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Thus , they retain the right t0 t0 t0 t0 and are funded in whole t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 ; t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 , t8 t8 , t8 t8 t8 t8 t9 t9 t9 t9 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Annual tuition fees t0 t0 t0 range from nothing t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The secondary level includes schools t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This category includes university-preparatory schools or " prep schools " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
High tuition , t0 t0 , is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Some private schools are boarding schools t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools .
Some such schools teach religious education , together with the usual academic subjects t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Others use the denomination as more of a general label t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
They include parochial schools , a term t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 religious groups represented in the K-12 private education sector include Protestants , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Private schools t0 t0 may be favoured for many reasons : prestige and the social status of the ' old school tie ' ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 ; t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education ; t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Student uniforms t0 t0 t0 t0 are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example , t1 t1 t1 .
Private schools t0 t0 are always more expensive than their public counterparts .

t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , capitalist firms t1 substitute capital equipment for labor inputs t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 to reduce costs and maximize profits .
t0 t0 t0 , this trend increases the organic composition of capital , meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs , increasing unemployment t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This process exerts a downward pressure t0 t0 .
The substitution of capital equipment t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 raises the productivity of each worker , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Wages work in the same way as prices t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill .
t0 t0 , inequality is driven by this price .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the price of skill is determined by a race t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , markets can also concentrate wealth , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 . t2
t0 Markets , t1 t1 , t2 t2 they t3 t3 , often lead to high levels of inequality , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 . t5
Employers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 will find that their business is chronically understaffed .
Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages t3 t3 .
A job t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 will result in a low wage t4 t4 t4 .
This t0 t0 competition between workers drives down the wage .
An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service .
Competition t0 t0 tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A job t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , will result in high wages t4 t4 t4 .
This t0 t0 competition between employers t1 employees will drive up the wage .
Examples of this would include jobs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
Competition t0 t0 tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining , t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level t1 t1 t1 .
However , most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity .
Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t6 , t6 t6 t6 t6 .
The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Another cause is the rate t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A progressive tax is a tax t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
Additionally , steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income t0 t0 t0 .
The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index t0 t0 is an indicator for the effects of such taxation .
An important factor t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is variation in individuals ' access to education .
Education , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , creates high wages for those t2 t2 t2 , t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , those t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 receive much lower wages .
The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment .
t0 , education raises incomes and promotes growth t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , economists with the Standard & Poor 's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S. 's wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , S & P recommended increasing access to education .
It estimated that if the average United States worker had completed just one more year of school , it would add an additional $ 105 billion in growth to the country 's economy over five years .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , there was an increase in skilled workers , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
High school education t0 t0 t0 was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work .
t0 t0 , it differs from the present high school education , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This decrease in wages caused a period of compression t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Education is very important for the growth of the economy , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer t0 t0 t0 of the CEPR point t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , they concluded " The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 . "
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the available evidence provides little support t1 t1 t1 that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Sociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 : high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa .
Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global t0 t0 t0 t0 .
When rich countries trade with poor countries , the low-skilled workers t0 t0 t0 t0 may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States .
He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
However , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15 % of rising income inequality .
Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries .
t0 t0 t0 , there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap .
t0 t0 , women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Thomas Sowell , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A U.S. Census 's report stated t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The income gap t0 t0 t0 ranges from 53 % in Botswana to -40 % t1 t1 .
Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development .
t0 t0 t0 , countries t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 have relatively equal distributions of wealth .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , it acquires more capital , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Kuznets saw t1 developing economies level of inequality bulging out t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Kuznets demonstrated this relationship t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , more recent testing of this theory t1 t1 t1 t1 has shown it to be very weak .
Kuznets ' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time .
t0 t0 t0 , income inequality did fall in the United States t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
However , recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s .
This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets ' theory .
It may be possible that another Kuznets ' cycle is occurring , specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector .
This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets ' cycles to be in effect at any given time .
Wealth concentration is a theoretical t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 process t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
According to this theory , those who t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 are the beneficiaries of the new wealth .
t0 t0 , wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality t1 t1 .
Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital t0 t0 t0 than economic growth t1 t1 t1 , and that larger fortunes generate higher returns .
Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A better explainer of growing inequality , t0 t0 t0 , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
This process , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , brings income not from creation of wealth but from " grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort "
Effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A similar relationship exists among US states t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem .
Increasing inequality harms economic growth .
t0 t0 t0 unemployment , t1 t1 t1 t1 , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth .
Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
Policies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 effects support economic growth .
British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
For most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This pattern t0 t0 t0 t1 still holds among poorer countries , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 .
Americans live no longer on average t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 than Greeks t1 t1 t1 t1 or New Zealanders t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
Life expectancy in Sweden t0 t0 t0 t0 and Japan t1 t1 t1 – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 – was longer .
t0 t0 t0 the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality .
Creating an index of " Health and Social Problems " t0 t0 t0 , authors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett found health and social problems t1 t1 t1 in countries with bigger income inequalities t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Other studies have confirmed this relationship .
The UNICEF index of " child well-being t0 t0 t0 " , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , correlates with greater equality t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society .
t0 studies t1 t1 t1 t1 have concentrated on homicides – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Daly et al. 2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates t0 t0 t0 .
They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state .
Fajnzylber t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 found a similar relationship worldwide .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 on the relationship between homicides and inequality are .
Following t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 – economic inequality is problematic .
A house that provides less utility to a millionaire t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , is an example of t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
An additional dollar t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 will go to things t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 , t3 , t3 t3 ; t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 decreases as a person becomes richer .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility .
Some studies have found evidence t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher .
Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 .
Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that " the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , " and consumption is more important than income .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The debate is summarized in " The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor " by journalist Thomas B. Edsall .
Other studies have not found consumption inequality t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and the CBO 's study found consumption data not " adequately " capturing " consumption t1 t1 t1 " t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
Central Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that " systematic economic inequalities , within the United States and around the world , have created deep financial ' fault lines ' t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " – t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners – t1 t1 t1 t1 – t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This has given the American economy a tendency to go " from bubble to bubble " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , then GDP growth t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , an increase t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 is associated with higher GDP growth .
The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
According to economists David Castells-Quintana and Vicente Royuela , increasing inequality harms economic growth .
t0 t0 t0 unemployment , t1 t1 t1 t1 , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth .
Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
Policies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 effects support economic growth .
Economist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Economist Branko Milanovic , wrote in 2001 t0 , t0 t0 that income inequality harms growth – t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The main reason t0 t0 shift is the increasing importance of human capital t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , savings and investments were key .
t0 it was important to have a large contingent of rich people t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , widespread education has become the secret to growth .
t0 t0 , Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development .
A 1996 study t0 t0 examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth .
He showed that , in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach , inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and higher level of fertility , and thereby lower levels of growth .
He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Perotti concluded that , more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education .
Both are reflected in higher rates of growth .
t0 , very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Research t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , found that there is " little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment " .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A study of Swedish counties t0 t0 t0 t0 found a positive impact of inequality on growth t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the Kuznets curve hypothesis , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
Economist Thomas Piketty challenges this notion , claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and " violent economic and political shocks " reduced inequality .
Moreover , Piketty argues that the " magical " Kuznets curve hypothesis , with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run , can not account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s .
Some theories t0 t0 t0 1970s established possible avenues t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , savings by the wealthy , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand .
A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality .
Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development .
Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 countries t1 t1 t1 have " succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years " t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 . t4
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth .
The effect of economic growth t0 t0 t0 – t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 – can depend on the existing level of inequality .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 40 % of its population t4 t4 t4 , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country t5 t5 t5 would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : t1 While economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty . t2
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system .
Much unregistered property is held in informal form t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land .
Other causes of extra-legal property are failures t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , argue that a shortage of affordable housing – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , rental prices increased rapidly t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The ad valorem property tax policy t0 t0 t0 t0 made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace .
t0 , certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , then t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those t2 t2 t2 equipped to manage their finances .
t0 , aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability .
The t0 the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This can be explained by the fact t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve t0 t0 t0 .
It t0 be noted here t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , there is nonetheless not more waste t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t4 , t4 t4 t4 .
Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , this multiplier would be lower , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the current high level of population has a large impact on this t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , human inequality can be addressed/corrected , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product .
Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force .
t0 , Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 ; t5 t5 only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls 's theory of justice .
The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself .
Its goal is to " wid t0 t0 t0 people 's choices and the level of their achieved well-being " t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they are in some way deprived of earning as much income t1 t1 t1 t1 .
An old , ill man can not earn as much as a healthy young man ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , income and economic inequality increases , and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid .
To prevent such inequality , this approach believes it 's important to have political freedom , economic facilities , social opportunities , transparency guarantees , and protective security to ensure that people are n't denied their functionings , capabilities , and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income .

The account of his travels , Il milione t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , appeared about the year 1299 .
Some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo 's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The Yuan undertook extensive public works .
Among Kublai Khan 's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer Guo Shoujing , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

Chinese travelers t0 t0 t0 were able to provide assistance in such areas t1 t1 t1 .
Contacts with the West t0 brought the introduction to China of a major food crop , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Yuan dynasty was the first time t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire .
Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 . t6
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , t0 , Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , there t2 exist Chinese people t3 t3 t3 t3 who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens , and that China stagnated economically and scientifically .
The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang , Song , as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties .
Chinese advisers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 gave strong influence to Kublai 's early court , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 : t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .

t0 , t0 a civilian bureaucracy , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , was created in China .
t0 t0 t0 another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 was established t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the actual functions of these ministries t1 reflected how Mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions .
t0 t0 , the authority of the Yuan legal system , the Ministry of Justice , did not extend to legal cases involving Mongols and Semuren , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Cases t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 group were decided by a mixed board t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Another example was the insignificance of the Ministry of War compared with native Chinese dynasties , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the ' Phags-pa script , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 , was preserved in the court t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Mongols practiced debt slavery , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 developments t2 t2 t2 occurred or continued in their development , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 , t3 , t3 , t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 , the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 there were many famous painters .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era .
In Yuan poetry , the main development was the qu , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

One of the key factors t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form .
One of the important cultural developments t0 t0 t0 t0 was the consolidation t1 t1 , t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art .
Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current , vernacular Chinese t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China , relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 .
There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty , t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 .
The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims t0 t0 .

Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The mathematician Zhu Shijie t0 t0 t0 solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation t0 t0 t0 t0 .
His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns , t0 t0 t0 .
The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascal 's triangle .
The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book .
Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars .
He was one of the first mathematicians t0 t0 to work on spherical trigonometry .

His calendar , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was disseminated in 1281 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of Song dynasty astronomer Shen Kuo t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences t0 t0 t0 t0 , but Mongol rulers were known to be interested t1 t1 t1 .

The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court .
Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
No Chinese translation of Western medical works is known , but it is possible that the Chinese had access to Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine .
The Mongol rulers patronized the Yuan printing industry .

t0 , t0 the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Mongols and the Semuren t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The unequal treatment is possibly t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 there were very few North t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate .

t0 t0 t0 , corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols .
The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng .
The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The historian Frederick W. Mote wrote that the usage of the term " social classes " for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth , but just entailed " degrees of privilege " to which they were entitled institutionally and legally , so a person 's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The reason t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and the reason t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 was the date t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The earlier they surrendered to the Mongols , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 were ranked .
The Northern Chinese were ranked higher t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Major commerce t0 t0 t0 gave rise to favorable conditions t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

The Central Region , t0 t0 t0 t0 , Shandong , Shanxi , the south-eastern part of present-day Inner Mongolia and the Henan areas t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly governed by the Central Secretariat t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 at Khanbaliq t3 t3 t3 t3 ; t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 .
The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , t1 t1 t1 , from viruses to parasitic worms , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , the immune system can be classified into subsystems , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , the blood–brain barrier , blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier , t1 t1 t1 t1 separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer .
Immunodeficiency occurs t0 the immune system is less active than normal , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , acquired conditions t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms .
Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system .
Immunology is a science t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It originates from medicine and early studies t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The t0 t0 reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens t1 t1 t1 .
Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom .
This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Pasteur 's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It was not until Robert Koch 's 1891 proofs , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The immune system protects organisms from infection t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , physical barriers prevent pathogens t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non-specific response .
Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , vertebrates possess a second layer of protection , the adaptive immune system , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , the immune system adapts its response t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This improved response is then retained t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , self molecules are those components of an organism 's body t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Conversely , non-self molecules are those t0 t0 t0 t0 .
One class of non-self molecules are called antigens t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Microorganisms or toxins t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system .
The innate response is usually triggered t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Innate immune defenses are non-specific , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This system does not confer long-lasting immunity t0 t0 t0 .
The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense t0 t0 t0 .
Several barriers protect organisms from infection , t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
The waxy cuticle of many leaves , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , other systems act to protect body openings t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The flushing action of tears and urine t0 mechanically expels pathogens , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Chemical barriers also protect against infection .
The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Enzymes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 are also antibacterials .
Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 , t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
This reduces the probability t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , oral antibiotics can lead to an " overgrowth " of fungi and cause conditions t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
There is good evidence t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system t0 t0 .
The symptoms of inflammation are redness , swelling , heat , and pain , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Eicosanoids include prostaglandins t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells ; t0 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released .
t0 cytokines and t1 chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
Phagocytes t0 patrol the body searching for pathogens , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Macrophages are versatile cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Macrophages also act as scavengers , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Leukocytes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 act like independent , single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system .
The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These cells identify and eliminate pathogens , either by attacking larger pathogens through contact t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system .
Dendritic cells t0 t0 t0 are phagocytes in tissues t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 , t3 , t3 , t3 t3 .
They are named for their resemblance t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , but dendritic cells are in no way t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Natural killer cells , t0 t0 t0 , are a component of the innate immune system t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , NK cells destroy compromised host cells , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 . t4
This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 – t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
They were named " natural killer " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 . t4
t0 t0 t0 it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells .
It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 immune system evolved in early vertebrates t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The ability t0 t0 t0 t0 responses is maintained in the body t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , these t1 memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it .
Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules t0 t0 t0 t0 .
T cells recognize a " non-self " target , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
There are two major subtypes of T cells : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response .
Killer T cells t0 recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell .
A third , minor subtype are the γδ T cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Killer T cells are a sub-group of T cells t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen .
Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor t0 t0 t0 binds to this specific antigen t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Recognition of t0 t0 : antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell , t1 t1 .
The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 an t1 T cell contacts t2 t2 , it releases cytotoxins , t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The entry of another toxin called granulysin t0 t0 t0 t0 induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis .
T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses .
T cell activation is tightly controlled t0 t0 requires t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Helper T cells express T cell receptors t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The MHC : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's CD4 co-receptor , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC : t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 : t3 t3 .
Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Cytokine signals t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Gamma t0 T cells t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 possess an alternative T cell receptor t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The conditions t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 cells are not fully understood .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity .
t0 t0 t0 , γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
A B cell identifies pathogens t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules .
This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , its offspring t1 t1 t1 t1 secrete millions of copies of the antibody t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph , bind to pathogens t0 t0 t0 and mark them for destruction t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly , by binding to bacterial toxins t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This is " adaptive " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory .
Newborn infants have no prior exposure t0 t0 and are particularly vulnerable to infection .
Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother .
t0 t0 , a particular type of antibody , called IgG , is transported from mother to baby t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 human babies t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 .
Breast milk or colostrum t0 contains antibodies t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This is passive immunity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 — t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This passive immunity is usually short-term , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , protective passive immunity can t1 be transferred artificially from one individual t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Hormones can act as immunomodulators , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses .
Some autoimmune diseases t0 t0 lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , male sex hormones t1 t1 t1 seem to be immunosuppressive .
Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well , most notably prolactin , growth hormone and vitamin D .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , proteins such as NFIL3 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 , t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 .
It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals .
t0 , some hormones are regulated by the immune system , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels .
t0 , they stay indoors more t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation .
t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D .
The main response of the immune system t0 tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells t1 t1 t1 t1 , sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells .
Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal .
NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 antibodies are generated against tumor cells t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , plants lack phagocytic cells , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 plant t1 t1 , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Systemic acquired resistance t0 t0 t0 is a type of defensive response t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , many T cells and antibodies react with " self " peptides .
One of the functions of specialized cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 .
Immunodeficiencies occur t0 one t1 t1 of the components of the immune system are inactive .
The ability of the immune system t0 t0 t0 t0 is diminished in both the young and the elderly , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function .
t0 , malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency t1 t1 t1 .
Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity , complement activity , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
Additionally , the loss of the thymus t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 in severe immunodeficiency and a t2 t2 to infection .
Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells .
Active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination .
The principle behind vaccination t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed .
The success of any pathogen depends on its ability t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses .
t0 t0 t0 , Frank Burnet , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , formulated the clonal selection theory t3 t3 t3 of immunity .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex " two-signal " activation of T cells .
The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the killing is indiscriminate t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 are affected , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Immunosuppressive drugs t0 t0 t0 prevent T cells from responding t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , during wake periods differentiated effector cells , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 during awake t1 times , anti-inflammatory molecules , such as cortisol t2 t2 , t2 .
There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time .
t0 , inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , inflammation may occur during sleep times t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it extends a vitamin D receptor .
This is essentially a signaling device t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
T-cells have a symbiotic relationship t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor , in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 can T-cells perform their intended function .
Other immune system cells t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , are dendritic cells , t1 t1 t1 .
Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Antimicrobial peptides t0 t0 are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life .
Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates .
Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 exist only in jawed vertebrates .
t0 , a t1 lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors t0 t0 t0 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
It is likely that a multicomponent , adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Many species , however , utilize mechanisms t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 .
Prokaryotes t0 possess acquired immunity , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Many theories have been suggested in immunology t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
According to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular t0 t0 t0 , it was cells – t1 t1 , t1 – t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , the humoral theory of immunity , t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components t3 t3 t3 found in the organism 's " humors " rather than its cells .
t0 , some tumors evade the immune system t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Some tumor cells t0 release products that inhibit the immune response ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Hypersensitivity is an immune response t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They are divided into four classes t0 t0 t0 – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death .
Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Type II hypersensitivity occurs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This is also called antibody-dependent t0 t0 t0 t0 hypersensitivity , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Immune complexes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions .
Type IV hypersensitivity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 usually takes between two and three days t1 t1 .
Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These reactions are mediated by T cells , t0 , t0 t0 .
An evasion strategy t0 t0 t0 t0 to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Other bacteria , t0 t0 t0 t0 , live inside a protective capsule t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Many pathogens secrete compounds t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Some bacteria form biofilms t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Such biofilms are present in many successful infections , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Other bacteria generate surface proteins t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated .
The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This is called antigenic variation .
An example is HIV , which mutates rapidly , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 are constantly changing .
These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy , constantly switching one type of surface protein t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Masking antigens t0 t0 t0 is another common strategy for avoiding detection t1 t1 t1 t1 .
In HIV , the t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; such " self-cloaked " viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as " non-self " structures .
Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors .
This is called immune surveillance .
The transformed cells of tumors express antigens t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , these antigens appear foreign , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; some are derived from oncogenic viruses t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 .
One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , transforms certain skin cells t1 t1 t1 t1 into tumors called melanomas .
A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Larger drugs t0 t0 t0 t0 can provoke a neutralizing immune response , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This limits the effectiveness of drugs t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the drug itself is not immunogenic , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Early techniques relied mainly on the observation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 .
A t0 t0 database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics .
Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , sleep and the t1 circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol , t2 , t2 t2 induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin , t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 .
These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
These cytokines t0 stimulate immune functions t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 .
It is t0 t0 t0 t1 undifferentiated , or less differentiated , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the milieu of hormones produced at this time t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 support the interactions between APCs and T-cells , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 .
This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens .
t0 simple unicellular organisms t1 t1 t1 possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Other t0 immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
These mechanisms include phagocytosis , t0 peptides called defensins , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Jawed vertebrates , t0 t0 , have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Adaptive t0 t0 t0 t0 immunity creates immunological memory t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination .
t0 t0 , this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response .
The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , they activate their protease activity , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
This produces a catalytic cascade t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The cascade results t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , increase vascular permeability , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane .
The Intergovernmental Panel t0 t0 Change t1 t1 t1 is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It was first established in 1988 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP .
The IPCC produces reports that support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to " stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " .
IPCC reports cover " the scientific , t0 and t1 information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 . "

t0 t0 t0 t0 , closed plenary sessions were held .
The meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at Sessions t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
Annual cash contributions t0 t0 t0 t0 are made by the WMO , t1 t1 , and by IPCC Members ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The organisation is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO .
The IPCC does not carry out research t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources .
Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Each chapter has a number of authors t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A chapter t0 has two " coordinating lead authors " , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The t0 lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters .
Contributing authors prepare text , graphs or data for inclusion t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The executive summary of the WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions t0 t0 t0 t0 are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases , resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth 's surface .
They calculate with confidence t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They predict that under a " business as usual " t0 t0 t0 scenario , global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °C per decade during the t1 t1 t1 century .
They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years , broadly consistent with prediction of climate models , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more .
t0 t0 , 16 t1 science academies issued a joint statement on climate change .
The joint statement was made by the Australian Academy of Science , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
The statement , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , stated t2 t2 support the t3 t3 t3 t3 conclusion that it is at least 90 % certain t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t7 .
The TAR has t0 been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the TAR .
t0 t0 t0 , Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers t1 t1 t1 does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report .
t0 t0 , Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models .
John Houghton , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , has responded to Lindzen 's criticisms of the SPM .
Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world 's governments , and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the IPCC is publishing Special Reports t1 t1 t1 .
The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows the same procedures t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 two IPCC Special Report were finalized , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
Both Special Reports were requested by governments .
The IPCC concentrates its activities t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it t1 supports other activities , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This involves publishing default emission factors , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This projection was not included in the final summary t0 t0 .
The IPCC has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
They expressed regret t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 " .
The date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the IPCC from the WWF report , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Former IPCC chairman Robert Watson has said " The mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact " .
That is worrying .
The IPCC needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened .
Martin Parry , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , said that " What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance " t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The third assessment report t0 t0 t0 t0 featured a graph labeled " Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
This graph extended the similar graph t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The schematic was not an actual plot of data , and was based on a diagram of temperatures t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the maximum t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007 .
The MBH99 finding was supported by t0 reconstructions t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Jones t0 al. and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900 , and the MBH99 based graph t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , this finding was disputed by contrarians : t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t3 , t3 , t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t9 t10 t10 t10 t10 .
Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic , t0 t0 t0 as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report , and argued that " Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report , the IPCC presented the ' Hockey Stick ' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report " .
Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was picked up by the Bush administration , and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that " manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people " .
The data t0 t0 used to produce the " hockey stick graph " was criticized in papers t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Rep. Joe Barton , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 wrote joint letters t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 .
Sherwood Boehlert , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , said this was a " misguided and illegitimate investigation " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The National Research Council 's report agreed that there were some statistical failings , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t2 Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that " more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached " and that the uncertainties were " the point of the article " .
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 featured a graph t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , including the three t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 ; t5 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
t0 t0 , analysis of the Medieval Warm Period cited reconstructions by Crowley & Lowery 2000 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 and Osborn & Briffa 2006 .
Ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1,000 years t0 t0 .
Most reconstructions shared some data series , t0 tree ring t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The section discussed the divergence problem t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001 .
The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 , the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Another example of scientific research t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 is a study on projected rises in sea levels .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m t3 t3 t3 t3 above 1990 levels " .
These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 .
This may have been due , in part , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Michael Oppenheimer , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring , smaller assessments t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 the large scale approach t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties .
Others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus t0 t0 t0 t0 and ask to include dissenting or minority positions t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
The IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
In case of the Ozone depletion global regulation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 has been successful , in case of Climate Change , the Kyoto Protocol failed .
The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process .
The lockstep situation of the IPCC is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The t0 t0 model of policy-making of more knowledge we have , t1 t1 the political response will be is being doubted .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties .
The ozone case communicated to lay persons " with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 sharing t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 remain an unsolved problem .
In the UK , a report t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it operates on the basis of scientific papers t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
t0 t0 , this means that any significant new evidence or events t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 can not be included .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , this has been raised as a serious shortcoming t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
However , there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 – t5 t5 or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes t6 t6 t6 .
They suggested a range of new organizational options , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference .
A prime number t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is a natural number greater than 1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A natural number greater than 1 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is called a composite number .
t0 t0 , 5 is prime t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes t0 t0 t0 : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The uniqueness t0 t0 t0 requires excluding 1 as a prime t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
The property of being prime t0 t0 t0 t0 is called primality .
A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division .
It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 t0 .
Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers .
These include the Miller–Rabin primality test , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , and the AKS primality test , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the largest t2 prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits .
There are infinitely many primes , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
There is no known simple formula t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the distribution of primes , t1 t1 t1 t1 , the statistical behaviour of primes t2 t2 t2 , can be modelled .
The first result t0 t0 t0 is the prime number theorem , proven at the end of the 19th century , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Primes are used in several routines in information technology , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Hence , 6 is not prime .
The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
No even number greater than 2 is prime t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 .
This implies that n is not prime .
Accordingly , the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1 , t2 , t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 are multiples t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number .
t0 t0 t0 t0 Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime .
t0 t0 , Derrick Norman Lehmer 's list of primes t1 t1 t1 , reprinted as late as 1956 , started with 1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 , the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 , the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
There are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 .
However , the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks .
Euclid 's Elements t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 contain important theorems t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime .
The Sieve of Eratosthenes , t0 t0 t0 , is a simple method to compute primes , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
After the Greeks , little happened with the study of prime numbers t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 Pierre de Fermat stated t1 t1 t1 t1 Fermat 's little theorem t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , the t1 next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
They are called Mersenne primes in his honor .
The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division .
This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , then n is not a prime , t1 it is a prime .
t0 , if is composite t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 then one of the factors t2 t2 t2 is necessarily at most .
t0 t0 , t1 , the trial divisions are by t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 .
None of these numbers divides 37 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This routine can be implemented more efficiently t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 — t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , only three divisions are necessary t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 and 6 are composite .
Modern primality tests t0 t0 t0 t1 can be divided into two main classes , probabilistic t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 and deterministic algorithms .
Deterministic algorithms provide a way t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , trial division is a deterministic algorithm because , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster , but do not completely prove that a number is prime .
These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way .
t0 t0 , a given test might pass t1 the time t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , but pass only with probability p t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 the probability t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 is 1/(1-p)n , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , then we know that the number is composite .
A particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test , which relies on the fact t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 that np≡n t1 t1 t1 t1 for any n t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 a number b that we want to test for primality , t1 t1 work out nb t2 t2 t2 t2 for a random value of n t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 there are some composite numbers t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime , t2 t2 t2 has no way t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 , are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Are prime .
Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes .
Other primes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 include the Sophie Germain primes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 , prime numbers that are t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , where p is an arbitrary prime .
The Lucas–Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form .
This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers .
The following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types .
Some of these primes have been found using t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US $ 100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $ 150,000 and $ 250,000 for primes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 .
Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Are prime for any natural number n .
Here represents the floor function , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
The latter formula t0 be shown using Bertrand 's postulate t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 , computing A or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes t1 t1 t1 .
Another formula is based on Wilson 's theorem and generates the number 2 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , their greatest t1 divisor is one .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Dirichlet 's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : the numbers are t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Primes are highlighted in red .
The rows t0 t0 t0 starting with a = 3 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 there are infinitely many prime numbers .
t0 t0 t0 , the primes are distributed equally among those rows t1 t1 t1 t1 — t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The zeta function is closely related to prime numbers .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 : t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 then ζ t5 t5 t5 would have a finite value .
t0 , the harmonic series t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 diverges t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 must be infinitely many primes .
Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity t0 t0 t0 t0 , due to Euler .
The unproven Riemann hypothesis , t0 t0 t0 , states that except for s = −2 , −4 , ... , all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal t1 t1 .
The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct .
t0 t0 , the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed .
Often having an elementary formulation , many t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 : all four of Landau 's problems t2 t2 are still unsolved .
One of them is Goldbach 's conjecture , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 proven , for example Vinogradov 's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes .
Chen 's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime , the product of two primes .
Also , any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes .
The branch of number theory t0 t0 t0 is called additive number theory .
A third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes .
It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes , pairs of primes with difference 2 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , it states that for every positive integer n , there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n .
It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1 .
These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel 's hypothesis H .
Brocard 's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2 .
Legendre 's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n .
It is implied by the stronger Cramér 's conjecture .
Giuga 's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 5 , 1/p is always a recurring decimal , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , provided that p is not a prime factor of q .
Wilson 's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p − 1)! + 1 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Moreover , an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n − 1)! is divisible by n .
t0 t0 cryptography algorithms , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , are based on large prime numbers t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
RSA relies on the assumption t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Diffie–Hellman t0 t0 relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The evolutionary strategy t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 Magicicada make use of prime numbers .
These insects spend most of their lives t0 t0 underground .
They t0 pupate and then emerge from their burrows t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 they fly about , breed , and then die t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 predators t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 , t2 , t2 t2 t2 would be sure to meet them .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , average predator populations t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 would be up to 2 % higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas .
t0 t0 , this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle t1 t1 t1 .
The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , t0 prime t1 indicates minimality or indecomposability , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing t1 t1 and 1 .
It is either Q or the finite field with p elements , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , additional meaning is intended by using the word prime , t1 t1 t1 t1 can be , t2 t2 , decomposed into its prime components .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots .
Prime models t0 t0 t0 are other examples t1 t1 t1 .
Prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
An element p of R is called prime element t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 and satisfies the following requirement : : : : : : : t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and can not be written as a product of two ring elements t0 t0 t0 t0 .
In the ring Z of integers , the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements , t0 t0
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains .
An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers .
Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes .
Not every prime t0 t0 t0 t0 is a Gaussian prime : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Rational primes t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal .
Prime ideals , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , are an important tool t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The prime ideals of the ring of integers are t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 , t6
The t0 theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker–Noether theorem , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 .
Prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , factorization or ramification of prime ideals t1 lifted to an extension field , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , bears some resemblance with ramification t3 t3 .
t0 ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , prime ideals t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2
t0 t0 , this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
While completing Q t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 with respect t1 t1 t1 t1 yields the field of real numbers , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 yields the field of p-adic numbers .
These are essentially all possible ways t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Certain arithmetic questions t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 may be transferred back and forth to the completed t1 t1 t1 t1 fields .
This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes t0 t0 t0 .
Prime numbers have influenced many artists t0 t0 .
The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through " natural phenomena " .
t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 to create unpredictable rhythms : t4 t4 t4 , t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 this way of composing was " inspired by the movements of nature , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 .
The Rhine t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is a European river t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .

The spelling with Rh- in English Rhine t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is due to the influence of Greek orthography , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The diphthong t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 is a Central German development t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , the t3 name t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 , t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 , t8 .
Spanish is with French in adopting the Germanic vocalism t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .

Most of the delta is a nature reserve t0 t0 t0 .
It includes the Austrian towns of Gaißau , Höchst and Fußach .

A regulation of the Rhine was called for , with an upper canal t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
Its water has a darker color t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake .
This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee .
Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water : t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .

The cold water flows near the surface t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The flow reappears on the surface t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The water t0 follows the northern shore t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau t0 t0 t0 .
Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , this flow of the Rhine water t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Rhine emerges from Lake Constance , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
The Aare t0 than doubles the Rhine 's water discharge , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Aare also contains the waters t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Rhine roughly forms the German-Swiss border from Lake Constance t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the first major city t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , is located the " Rhine knee " ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
Here the High Rhine ends .
Legally , the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine .
The river now flows North as Upper Rhine t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The most important tributaries t0 t0 t0 are the Ill below of Strasbourg , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , the Rhine leaves the Upper Rhine Valley t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by a Rhine straightening program t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The rate of flow was increased t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Dead branches dried up t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Grand Canal d ' Alsace was dug , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , there are large compensation pools , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
The Rhine is the longest river in Germany .
It is here t0 the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 , t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Northeastern France drains to the Rhine t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of 2,290 m3/s t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 and an average width of 400 m t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine Gorge , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The rate of erosion equaled the uplift t0 t0 t0 , such that the river was left at about its original level t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The gorge is quite deep t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site t0 t0 t0 and known as " the Romantic Rhine " , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , industry was a major source of water pollution .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
Duisburg is the home of Europe 's largest inland port and functions as a hub t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
The Ruhr , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , is nowadays a clean river , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water .
It contributes 70 m3/s t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 to the Rhine .
Other rivers t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , the Emscher , still carry a considerable degree of pollution .
The t0 economic sectors t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 are viniculture and tourism .
The Rhine Gorge t0 t0 t1 t1 and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine flows around the famous rock Lorelei .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Middle Rhine Valley can be considered the epitome of the Rhine romanticism .
The Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia .
Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation t0 t0 , the Rhine-Ruhr region .
One of the most important cities t0 t0 t0 is Duisburg with the largest river port t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural .
In Wesel , 30 km downstream of Duisburg , is located the western end of the second east-west shipping route , the Wesel-Datteln Canal , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , crosses the 400 m wide river .
Near Krefeld , the river crosses the Uerdingen line , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the situation becomes more complicated , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west , through the Waal and then , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Beneden Merwede branches off , t0 t0 and continues as the Noord , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The Oude Maas branches off , near Dordrecht , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The other third of the water flows through the Pannerdens Kanaal and redistributes in the IJssel t0 t0 .
The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the Rhine north into the IJsselmeer t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek .
It flows farther west , to rejoin the Noord River into the Nieuwe Maas t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The name Rijn , t0 t0 t0 , is used only for smaller streams t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The latter flows west into a sluice t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This branch t0 formed the line t1 which the Limes Germanicus were built .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Rhine took a t2 turn , creating the Channel River , the course of which now lies below the English Channel .
The Rhine-Meuse Delta , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 begins near Millingen aan de Rijn , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the t1 term Rhine Delta is commonly used .
However , this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : first , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This creates three main flows , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
The t0 and t1 main branch begins as Waal t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
The middle flow begins as Nederrijn , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The northern flow keeps the name IJssel t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Three more flows carry significant amounts of water : the Nieuwe Merwede t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 ; t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 , t9 t9 t9 , t10 t10 t10 t10 t10 t10 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the Meuse flowed t2 south t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This system of numerous bays , t0 t0 rivers , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , is hard to imagine today .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Meuse was separated from the Waal t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta 's main arms , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Many rivers have been closed t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and now serve as drainage channels t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century fundamentally .
Currently Rhine water runs into the sea , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 .
The Rhine-Meuse Delta is a tidal delta , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This meant that high tide formed a serious risk t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 , the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel .
t0 t0 t0 , the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography : Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees ; t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The compression and orogeny continue today , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the t1 Alpine orogeny caused a N–S rift system to develop in this zone .
The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben , in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps ; t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine extended its watershed t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the upper reaches of the Main , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , captured from the Meuse , t3 t3 t3 .
Around 2.5 million years ago t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was the geological period of the Ice Ages .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , six t1 Ice Ages have occurred , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine followed a course t1 t1 t1 , through the present North Sea .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This caused the Rhine 's course to be diverted through the English Channel .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the river mouth was located offshore of Brest , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , became tributaries t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Rhine built deltas , in what is now the Netherlands .
The last glacial ran from ~74,000 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , until the end of the Pleistocene t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , it saw two very cold phases , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The English Channel , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 were dry land , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Most of the Rhine 's current course was not under the ice t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A tundra , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , stretched across middle Europe , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Such was the case t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The loess or t0 dust t1 t1 t1 , settled in and around the Rhine Valley , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring .
Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension .
Rapid warming and changes of vegetation , t0 t0 forest , began about 13,000 BP .
t0 t0 t0 , Europe was fully forested .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , ocean water levels rose t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Meltwater , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , drowned the former coasts of Europe t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , a situation with tides and currents , t1 t1 t1 t1 has existed .
Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the sea level is still rising , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , it reworked its ice-age braidplain .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 rise t1 t1 t1 have strongly influenced delta evolution .
Other factors of importance t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault , the substrate and geomorphology , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , human impact is seen in the delta .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 , the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This caused increased flooding t0 t0 , ending peat formation t1 t1 t1 .
The shifting of river channels t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred .
Direct human impact t0 t0 t0 started with peat mining , t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This was followed by embankment , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , canals were dug , bends were short cut t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 .
The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709 , by river engineering works , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The Rhine was not known to Herodotus t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania .
The Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
In Roman geography , the Rhine formed the boundary between Gallia and Germania t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 . "
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube .
t0 t0 t0 she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The northern section of this frontier , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , remained the Roman boundary t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The southern part was different .
The upper Rhine t0 t0 t0 are easily crossed .
The frontier which they form is inconveniently long , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Romans kept eight legions in five bases t0 t0 t0 .
The actual number of legions present t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , depended on whether a state or threat of war existed .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the assignment of legions was as follows : for the army of Germania Inferior , two legions at Vetera t1 t1 t1 , I Germanica and XX Valeria t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 t8 .
Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This " Germanic Heroic Age " is reflected in medieval legend , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 , t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 , t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhine was within the borders of Francia .
t0 t0 t0 , it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The mouths of the Rhine , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , fell to the Burgundian Netherlands t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Alsace t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was sold to Burgundy t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The t0 historic castles t1 t1 attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany .
Establishing " natural borders " on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy , since the Middle Ages , though the language border was – t0 t0 – t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
French leaders , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine .
The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 , the Rhine crisis , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles .
This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies , until 1935 and after that , it would be a demilitarised zone , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision , t0 t0 , caused much resentment in Germany t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
The allies left the Rhineland , in 1930 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Britain and France were not inclined to do so , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany , by the Western Allies .
The Rhine bridge at Arnhem , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The bridges at Nijmegen , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , were also an objective of Operation Market Garden .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the Ludendorff Bridge , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , became famous , when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact – t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 – t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
This also became the subject of a film , The Bridge t0 t0 .
Seven Days t0 t0 t0 t0 was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe t1 t1 t1 t1 .

Islamism favors the reordering of government and society t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The different Islamist movements have been described as " oscillating between two poles " : t0 t0 t0 is a strategy of Islamization of society t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .

t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

t0 , a writer for the International Crisis Group maintains that " the conception of ' political Islam ' " is a creation of Americans to explain the Iranian Islamic Revolution and apolitical Islam was a historical fluke of the " short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970 " , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Western and pro-Western governments t1 supported sometimes fledgling Islamists and Islamist groups t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

His " encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement " was said to have been " imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years t0 t0 . "

t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations , and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the " gold standard " of religion t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .

Imperialism is a type of advocacy of empire .
Its name originated from the Latin word " imperium " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Imperialism is " a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world .
It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas .
The term imperialism has been applied to Western t0 t0 t0 t0 political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars .
Some writers , t0 t0 Edward Said , use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Imperialism is defined as " A policy of extending a country 's power and influence through diplomacy or military force . "
Imperialism is particularly focused on the control t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This is often through various forms of " othering " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 t0 .
There are " formal " or " informal " imperialisms .
" Formal imperialism " is defined as " physical control or full-fledged colonial rule " .
" Informal imperialism " is less direct ; t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 , t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , some writers t1 t1 t1 t1 used the term imperialism , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people t3 t3 .
To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of " formal " and " informal " imperialism , the first meaning physical control or " full-fledged colonial rule " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally .
This is t0 , t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area , or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully .
" The word ' empire ' comes from the Latin word imperium ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 .
The greatest distinction of an empire is t0 the amount of land t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Political power grew from conquering land , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
A distinction t0 t0 is t1 t1 t1 t1 empires were built mostly by expansion overland , t2 t2 t2 influences spread at least as much by sea t3 .
Some of the main aspects of trade that t0 t0 consisted of animals and plant products .
European empires t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism : t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory .
The two main regions are the core t0 t0 t0 .
The core consists of high areas of income and profit ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The Russian leader Lenin suggested that " imperialism was the highest form of capitalism , claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism , and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism " .
This idea t0 t0 stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era .
Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
The term " imperialism " is often conflated with " colonialism " , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition .
Imperialism and colonialism have been used t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions .
Colonialism t0 t0 t0 also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating ; t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Contiguous land empires t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism .
Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Imperialism and colonialism t0 dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another , imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Colonialism is t0 the imperial nation begins a conquest t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Colonialism 's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire , by conquering the other state 's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance .
Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure , physical structure and economics of an area ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies t0 t0 had great influence and were able to fund travelers t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
These societies also served as a space for travellers to share t0 t0 .
Political geographers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 supported imperialism .
Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state 's survival t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of European guidance .
t0 t0 , American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone .
Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said 's Orientalism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the British Empire " t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 .
British imperialism often used the concept of Terra nullius t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The country of Australia serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Orientalism , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East .
This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , by essentializing the East , this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Defining the East as a negative vision of itself , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the " scramble for Africa " .
He states that maps " contributed to empire by promoting , assisting , and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa " .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory .
This provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain " information t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 " .

The Americas t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 had large empires t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Cultural imperialism is when a country 's influence is felt in social and cultural circles , t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This is more than just " foreign " music , television or film becoming popular with young people , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
For example , depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians ; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series t0 t0 t0 .
The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 .
Nor is such a usage of culture t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .

t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 John Gallagher t2 t2 t2 and Ronald Robinson t3 t3 t3 constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism .
They claim that European imperialism was influential , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world t1 t1 t1 t1 .

t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Fieldhouse suggests that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in places such as Africa and Asia , this idea is not necessarily valid .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Europe also continued to advance in military technology .
European chemists made deadly explosives t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon .
This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience .
The term " Imperialism " was originally introduced into English t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It was shortly appropriated by supporters of " imperialism " t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed .
Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term .
Lenin t0 t0 exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
This conception of imperialism t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians .
t0 theoreticians t1 t1 t1 have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of " imperialism " .
Such writers have expanded the time period t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , in some accounts , t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , its meaning has shifted along five distinct t1 t1 t1 t1 : t2 t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 .
Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 , t0 t0 .
The t0 environmental determinism served as a moral justification t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
It was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , people t1 t1 t1 t1 were seen as " less civilized " therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy .
This takes two forms , t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the world could be split into climatic zones .
These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working , moral , and upstanding human being .
t0 , tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes , t1 t1 , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .

Céloron continued south t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Céloron threatened " Old Briton " with severe consequences t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
" Old Briton " ignored the warning .
t0 , Céloron returned to Montreal t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Céloron wrote , All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French , and are entirely devoted to the English .
I do n't know in what way they could be brought back .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , reports t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 were making their way to London and Paris , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
William Shirley , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , was particularly forceful , stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present .
Conflicts between the colonies , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory , and construct a fort for their protection .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims .
In 1750 Christopher Gist , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , explored the Ohio territory and opened t1 with the Indian tribes t2 t2 .
He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .

The War of the Austrian Succession t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 formally ended in 1748 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe .
The issues of conflicting territorial claims t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 were turned over to a commission t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Frontiers t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , were claimed by both sides .
The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , t0 , the Governor-General of New France , Marquis de la Jonquière , died and was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil .
His permanent replacement , the Marquis Duquesne , did not arrive in New France t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The t0 British activity t1 t1 t1 t1 prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Langlade was given 300 men , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 .
He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some aboriginal members of the expedition .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians .
His orders were to protect the King 's land t0 t0 t0 t0 from the British .
Marin followed the route t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , Marin constructed and garrisoned forts .
He t0 constructed Fort Presque Isle t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
He had a road t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Marin constructed a second fort t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , he drove off t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
He intensely disliked the French t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , he threatened the French with military action , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey , t2 t2 He who does great things . t3
He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois .
Later he was commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia .
They met at Albany , New York t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Mohawk Chief Hendrick , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Chief Hendrick said that the " Covenant Chain " , a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown , was broken .
Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 Dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old Major George Washington t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory .
Washington left with a small party , picking up along the way Jacob Van Braam t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 , Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf .
Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , invited Washington to dine with him .
t0 t0 , Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Saint-Pierre said , " t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , I do not think myself obliged to obey it . "
He told Washington that France 's claim t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men t1 t1 t1 to that point , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrecœur to relieve Saint-Pierre t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , Contrecœur generously allowed Trent 's small company to withdraw .
He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Dinwiddie ordered him to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work .
t0 t0 t0 , Washington learned of Trent 's retreat .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with the Mingo leader .
Learning of a French scouting party t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , surprised the Canadians on May 28 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
They killed many of the Canadians , including their commanding officer , Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
The historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people .
They had been inclined to support the French , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
One of Tanaghrisson 's men told Contrecoeur t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
News of the two battles reached England t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French .
They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition .
Word of the British military plans t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
The British , intending to blockade French ports , sent out their fleet in February 1755 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
An early important political response t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 was the convening of the Albany Congress t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 .
The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Braddock t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition t1 t1 t1 to take Fort Duquesne .
The expedition was a disaster .
It was attacked by French and Indian soldiers t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
Braddock called for a retreat .
He was killed .
Approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed t0 t0 .
The t0 500 British troops , t1 t1 t1 t1 , retreated to Virginia .
Two future opponents t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 , played key roles in organizing the retreat .
The French acquired a copy of the British war plans , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Shirley 's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , Shirley left garrisons at Oswego , t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Supplies for use in the projected attack t0 t0 were cached at Fort Bull .
Johnson 's expedition was better organized than Shirley 's , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 .
He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field .
Johnson 's advance stopped at Fort William Henry , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Colonel Monckton , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population t1 t1 t1 .
Monckton 's forces , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , forcibly removed thousands of Acadians , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the cutting off of supplies t1 t1 led to its demise .
The Acadian resistance , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , was sometimes quite stiff , t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , William Shirley assumed command of British forces t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , he laid out his plans for 1756 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , he proposed attacks on Fort Frontenac t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Shirley 's plan had little support .
Newcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers France sent to North America .
French t0 army reinforcements arrived in New France t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 , t2 , England formally declared war on France , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Governor Vaudreuil , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , acted during the winter of 1756 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain , so he ordered an attack t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , French forces destroyed the fort t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
They set back any British hopes t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , and endangered the Oswego garrison , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
French forces t0 t0 t0 t0 also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 .
The new British command was not in place t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them .
Montcalm took bold action against his inertia .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack t1 t1 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , Montcalm and the Indians t1 t1 t1 disagreed about the disposition of prisoners ' personal effects .
The Europeans did not consider t0 prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables , t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Loudoun , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , planned one major operation for 1757 : an attack t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , he began organizing for the expedition to Quebec .
He was then ordered by William Pitt , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 , to attack Louisbourg first .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the expedition was finally ready to sail from Halifax , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Loudoun returned to New York t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
French irregular forces t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757 .
t0 t0 they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga .
t0 t0 they launched a daring raid t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 , Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , some of Montcalm 's Indian allies , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , attacked the British column , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 , t2 , t2 t2 .
The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
A massive outbreak of smallpox t0 t0 t0 led many of them to stay away from trading t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry t2 t2 t2 .
Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , t1 , t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The British failures in North America , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , led to the fall t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
He embarked on a plan t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
He had been replaced by Abercrombie t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Two of the expeditions were successful , with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces .
The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Abercrombie saved something from the disaster t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
Abercrombie was recalled t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 , France 's t3 t3 minister , t4 t4 t4 t4 , decided to focus on an invasion of Britain , t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 .
The invasion failed t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , some French supply ships managed to depart France , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , James Wolfe t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The victory was made complete in 1760 when , despite losing outside Quebec City t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the British were able to prevent the arrival of French relief ships t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Governor Vaudreuil negotiated from Montreal a capitulation with General Amherst .
Amherst granted Vaudreuil 's request that any French residents t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
France chose to cede the former , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands ' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs t0 t0 t0 .
The t0 t0 philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada t1 as nothing more than a few acres of snow .
The British , t0 t0 t0 , were happy to take New France , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Spain , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , also gained Louisiana , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 .
Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations .
Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands ; t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Others migrated to places t0 t0 , and fled to New Orleans t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population .
The French word " Acadien " evolved to " Cadien " , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 , King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 t1 t1 t1 , t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population , a demarcation t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The proclamation also contained provisions t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 ; t4 t4 maintained French Civil law , t5 t5 t5 t5 , t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t6 t7 t7 t7 t7 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the elimination of French power t1 t1 t1 meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The change of control t0 t0 also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave .
Most went to Cuba , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Philosophers t0 t0 used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 this was due t1 an t2 understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction , t3 t3 t3 t3 view of the nature of natural motion .
A fundamental error was the belief t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Most of the previous misunderstandings t0 t0 t0 t0 were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , Einstein developed a theory of relativity t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles t0 t0 t0 are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed .
Only four main interactions are known : t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 : t1 , t1 , t1 , t1 t1 .
High-energy particle physics observations t0 during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction .
Aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different " natural places " therein .
Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth , those t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone .
He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their " natural place " t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This theory , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 .
Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 carries the projectile to its target .
This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place t0 t0 .
The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Galileo constructed an experiment t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 .
Newton 's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This law is an extension t0 t0 t0 t0 that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , Newton 's First Law t2 connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities .
t0 , t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , it is impossible to determine which object is " in motion " and which object is " at rest " .
t0 t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 , the laws of physics do not change from being at rest .
A person can throw a ball straight up in the air t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This is true t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
It is the inertia of the ball t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 : It is the outside world t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable .
Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The concept of inertia can be further generalized t0 explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration , such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object , were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames .
This is why , for example , astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth , and why Newton 's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 , it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This is the same thing t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Newton 's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements .
However , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , there are still deep questions t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 , Newton 's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Newton 's Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies , t0 t0 t0 t0 and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the second body exerts a force −F on the first body .
F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite t0 t0 .
This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The action and the reaction are simultaneous .
This means that in a closed system of particles , there are no internal forces t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the t1 force t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 will not cause the center of mass of the system to accelerate .
The constituent objects only accelerate with respect t0 t0 t0 , the system itself remains unaccelerated .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics .
Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , forces are classified as " vector quantities " .
This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the situation is ambiguous .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be .
The two people could be pulling against each other t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other .
Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems .
t0 , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 : t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the resulting force , the resultant t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum , t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , their respective lines of application must t2 be specified t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , forces can t1 be resolved into independent components t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 .
A horizontal force t0 t0 can t1 be split into two forces , t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force .
Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , the components of the vector sum are t1 determined by the scalar t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Orthogonal components are independent of each other t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient .
Choosing a basis vector t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 is desirable , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two .
Pushing against an object t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the static friction force t2 balances the applied force t3 t3 t3 t3 .
The static friction increases or decreases in response t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
A static equilibrium t0 t0 t0 is the most usual way of measuring forces , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
Using such tools , some quantitative force laws were discovered : that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 ; t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 ; t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 ; t5 t5 t5 t6 t6 t6 ; t7 t7 t7 t7 t8 t8 .
These were all formulated and experimentally verified t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an " absolute rest frame " did not exist .
Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest .
This was contrary to Aristotle 's notion of a " natural state " of rest t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Simple experiments showed that Galileo 's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct .
t0 t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 , the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat t2 t2 t2 .
Thus , no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity .
A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , a force is applied in the direction of motion t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This results in zero net force , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it continues to move with a non-zero velocity .
Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion .
The notion " force " keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This has the consequence t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , i.e. they appear in discrete portions .
This is , of course , difficult to imagine in the context of " forces " .
t0 , the potentials V t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 or fields , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , are treated similar to classical position variables , t3 , .
t0 , t1 t1 t1 t1 there is one " caveat " , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , and there is the Pauli principle t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , identical particles split into two different classes , t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 function t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 the spatial variables must be antisymmetric t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , and vice versa , i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be " fundamental interactions " .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a momentum conservation results t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
This description applies to all forces t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , each matter particle is represented as a straight line t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 , t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 .
Matter and anti-matter particles are identical t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices , and the Feynman diagram represents any force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex t0 t0 t0 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
All of the forces t0 t0 t0 are based on four fundamental interactions .
The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
All t0 forces t1 t1 derive from these four fundamental interactions .
t0 t0 , friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , and the Pauli exclusion principle , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
t0 , the forces in springs , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position .
Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The development of fundamental theories t0 t0 proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas .
t0 t0 , Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation .
Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 are manifestations of matter t2 t2 t2 interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons .
This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism , but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete .
A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction t0 t0 t0 t0 is held out as a possibility t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 .
Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects .
Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object .
t0 , this acceleration due to gravity t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 is usually designated as and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 , and points toward the center of the Earth .
This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth 's surface is directly proportional to the object 's mass .
Thus an object t0 t0 t0 mass t1 will experience a force .
Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances .
t0 t0 , Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Further , Newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body .
Combining these ideas gives a formula t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
t0 t0 t0 , a dimensional constant is used to describe the relative strength of gravity .
This constant has come to be known as Newton 's Universal Gravitation Constant , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 ; this was widely reported in the press t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
Newton , however , realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion , his law of gravity had to be universal .
It was only the orbit t0 t0 t0 Mercury t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 ; however , despite some early indications , no such planet could be found .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury 's orbit and found that his theory added a correction , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
This was the first time t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 t0 , t0 t0 t0 , general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity .
t0 t0 , gravitation is not viewed as a force , but rather , objects t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 travel under their own inertia t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 – t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever .
It is t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 that the curvature of space-time can be observed t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Thus , the straight line path t0 t0 is seen as a curved line in space , and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object .
t0 t0 , a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
Its space-time trajectory t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 is almost a straight line , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as " gravitational force " .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a rule of vector multiplication t1 Lorentz 's Law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field .
The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 and the magnetic force t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 t0 , this is the law .
The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 .
These " Maxwell Equations " fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges , t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be " self-generating " through a wave t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations , t1 t1 t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 , proved troublesome .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics .
This t0 modification t1 t1 t1 ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics t2 t2 t2 t2 , which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons .
t0 t0 , photons are the fundamental exchange particle , t1 t1 t1 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 .
It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
However , these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle .
t0 t0 t0 t0 , they can not occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them t1 , t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
This means that it takes energy to pack them together .
t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 , it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states .
The strong force t0 acts directly upon t1 particles .
However , a residual of the force is observed between hadrons t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
t0 the strong force acts t1 , transmitted as gluons , t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t3 t3 , t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 .
The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable .
This phenomenon is called color confinement .
The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons .
Its t0 familiar effect is beta decay t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 t1 .
The word " weak " derives from the fact t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 .
t0 , it is stronger than gravity t1 t1 t1 .
