<s> The Normans were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy , a region in France . <\s>
<s> They were descended from Norse raiders and pirates from Denmark , Iceland and Norway who , under their leader Rollo , agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia . <\s>
<s> Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations , their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia . <\s>
<s> The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries . <\s>
<s> The Norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East . <\s>
<s> The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety , becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated . <\s>
<s> They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as Norman , Normaund or Norman French , an important literary language . <\s>
<s> The Duchy of Normandy , which they formed by treaty with the French crown , was a great fief of medieval France , and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . <\s>
<s> The Normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations . <\s>
<s> Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines , and an expedition on behalf of their duke , William the Conqueror , led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . <\s>
<s> Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East , where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant , to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain , to Ireland , and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands . <\s>
<s> The English name `` Normans '' comes from the French words Normans/Normanz , plural of Normant , modern French normand , which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann `` Northman '' or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr , Latinized variously as Nortmannus , Normannus , or Nordmannus to mean `` Norseman , Viking '' . <\s>
<s> In the course of the 10th century , the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property . <\s>
<s> The Duchy of Normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo , and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria . <\s>
<s> The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions . <\s>
<s> The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine , but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine . <\s>
<s> The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen , and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II . <\s>
<s> Before Rollo 's arrival , its populations did not differ from Picardy or the Île-de-France , which were considered `` Frankish '' . <\s>
<s> Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s , but were divided between colonies in the east around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula , and were separated by traditional pagii , where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers . <\s>
<s> Rollo 's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes , Norwegians , Norse–Gaels , Orkney Vikings , possibly Swedes , and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control . <\s>
<s> The descendants of Rollo 's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people , blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique `` Norman '' culture in the north of France . <\s>
<s> The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d ' oïl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class , and it developed into the regional language that survives today . <\s>
<s> The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France , and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England . <\s>
<s> The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy , most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty . <\s>
<s> Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry , and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation . <\s>
<s> Many Normans of Italy , France and England eventually served as avid Crusaders under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart . <\s>
<s> Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy , they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia , fighting against the Pechenegs , the Bulgars , and especially the Seljuk Turks . <\s>
<s> Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines , but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily . <\s>
<s> They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038–40 . <\s>
<s> There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy , and it now seems likely only a few came from there . <\s>
<s> It is also unknown how many of the `` Franks '' , as the Byzantines called them , were Normans and not other Frenchmen . <\s>
<s> One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Hervé in the 1050s . <\s>
<s> By then however , there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia . <\s>
<s> They were based at Malatya and Edessa , under the Byzantine duke of Antioch , Isaac Komnenos . <\s>
<s> In the 1060s , Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks . <\s>
<s> Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population , but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos . <\s>
<s> Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia . <\s>
<s> Later , many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains . <\s>
<s> A Norman named Oursel led a force of `` Franks '' into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria . <\s>
<s> From 1073 to 1074 , 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans — formerly of Oursel — led by Raimbaud . <\s>
<s> They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle : Afranji , meaning `` Franks . '' <\s>
<s> The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy . <\s>
<s> Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration , when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors . <\s>
<s> The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul , the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d ' Aulps , and that group of Albanian clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under George Maniaces in the Sicilian expedition of 1038 . <\s>
<s> Robert Guiscard , an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes , ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy . <\s>
<s> Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal , Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church . <\s>
<s> After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia , in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania , capturing Valona , Kanina , Jericho , and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages . <\s>
<s> They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea , devastating everything along the way . <\s>
<s> Under these harsh circumstances , the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans . <\s>
<s> The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival . <\s>
<s> Immediately before the battle , the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city . <\s>
<s> Forced to retreat , Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium . <\s>
<s> The city 's garrison resisted until February 1082 , when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there . <\s>
<s> The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland ; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica . <\s>
<s> Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy . <\s>
<s> They lost Dyrrachium , Valona , and Butrint in 1085 , after the death of Robert . <\s>
<s> A few years after the First Crusade , in 1107 , the Normans under the command of Bohemond , Robert 's son , landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time , but to no avail . <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , they occupied Petrela , the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis , Gllavenica , Kanina and Jericho . <\s>
<s> This time , the Albanians sided with the Normans , dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them . <\s>
<s> With their help , the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra . <\s>
<s> The lack of supplies , disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis . <\s>
<s> The further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185 , when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium , owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials . <\s>
<s> Some time later , Dyrrachium — one of the most important naval bases of the Adriatic — fell again to Byzantine hands . <\s>
<s> The Normans were in contact with England from an early date . <\s>
<s> Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts , they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel . <\s>
<s> This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma , sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy , and King Ethelred II of England . <\s>
<s> Because of this , Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013 , when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard . <\s>
<s> His stay in Normandy influenced him and his sons by Emma , who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great 's conquest of the isle . <\s>
<s> When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father 's refuge in 1041 , at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut , he brought with him a Norman-educated mind . <\s>
<s> He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters , some of whom established an English cavalry force . <\s>
<s> This concept never really took root , but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward . <\s>
<s> He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford . <\s>
<s> He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II , Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051 , an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex . <\s>
<s> In 1066 , Duke William II of Normandy conquered England killing King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings . <\s>
<s> The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England . <\s>
<s> The nobility of England were part of a single Normans culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel . <\s>
<s> Early Norman kings of England , as Dukes of Normandy , owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent . <\s>
<s> They considered England to be their most important holding . <\s>
<s> Eventually , the Normans merged with the natives , combining languages and traditions . <\s>
<s> In the course of the Hundred Years ' War , the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English . <\s>
<s> The Anglo-Norman language became distinct from the Latin language , something that was the subject of some humour by Geoffrey Chaucer . <\s>
<s> The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects and influenced it , helping in the development of Middle English . <\s>
<s> It in turn evolved into Modern English . <\s>
<s> The Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169 . <\s>
<s> Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity . <\s>
<s> Yet , with time , they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became `` more Irish than the Irish themselves . '' <\s>
<s> The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland , later known as the Pale , and also built many fine castles and settlements , including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle . <\s>
<s> Both cultures intermixed , borrowing from each other 's language , culture and outlook . <\s>
<s> Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames . <\s>
<s> Names such as French , Roche , Devereux , D ' Arcy , Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland , especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established . <\s>
<s> Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there . <\s>
<s> Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell derived from the French Norman name Morel . <\s>
<s> Other names beginning with Fitz indicate Norman ancestry . <\s>
<s> These included Fitzgerald , FitzGibbons dynasty , Fitzmaurice . <\s>
<s> Other families bearing such surnames as Barry and De Búrca are also of Norman extraction . <\s>
<s> One of the claimants of the English throne opposing William the Conqueror , Edgar Atheling , eventually fled to Scotland . <\s>
<s> King Malcolm III of Scotland married Edgar 's sister Margaret , and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland 's southern borders . <\s>
<s> William invaded Scotland in 1072 , riding as far as Abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships . <\s>
<s> Malcolm submitted , paid homage to William and surrendered his son Duncan as a hostage , beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England . <\s>
<s> Normans came into Scotland , building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings , such as Robert the Bruce , as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans . <\s>
<s> King David I of Scotland , whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy , was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland , part of the process some scholars call the `` Davidian Revolution '' . <\s>
<s> Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England , and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair , David had to reward many with lands . <\s>
<s> The process was continued under David 's successors , most intensely of all under William the Lion . <\s>
<s> The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland . <\s>
<s> Scottish families of the names Bruce , Gray , Ramsay , Fraser , Ogilvie , Montgomery , Sinclair , Pollock , Burnard , Douglas and Gordon to name but a few , and including the later royal House of Stewart , can all be traced back to Norman ancestry . <\s>
<s> Even before the Norman Conquest of England , the Normans had come into contact with Wales . <\s>
<s> Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the Marches and warring with the Welsh . <\s>
<s> In these original ventures , the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales . <\s>
<s> Subsequent to the Conquest , however , the Marches came completely under the dominance of William 's most trusted Norman barons , including Bernard de Neufmarché , Roger of Montgomery in Shropshire and Hugh Lupus in Cheshire . <\s>
<s> These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference . <\s>
<s> Norman words , such as baron , first entered Welsh at that time . <\s>
<s> The legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the First Crusade carved out a Norman principality in Antioch . <\s>
<s> They were major foreign participants in the Reconquista in Iberia . <\s>
<s> In 1018 , Roger de Tosny travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from Moorish lands , but failed . <\s>
<s> In 1064 , during the War of Barbastro , William of Montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty . <\s>
<s> In 1096 , Crusaders passing by the siege of Amalfi were joined by Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred with an army of Italo-Normans . <\s>
<s> Bohemond was the de facto leader of the Crusade during its passage through Asia Minor . <\s>
<s> After the successful Siege of Antioch in 1097 , Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city . <\s>
<s> Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of Jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the Crusader kingdom in Transjordan and the region of Galilee . <\s>
<s> The conquest of Cyprus by the Anglo-Norman forces of the Third Crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island , which would be under Western European domination for the following 380 years . <\s>
<s> Although not part of a planned operation , the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected . <\s>
<s> In April 1191 Richard the Lion-hearted left Messina with a large fleet in order to reach Acre . <\s>
<s> But a storm dispersed the fleet . <\s>
<s> After some searching , it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancée Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus , together with the wrecks of several other ships , including the treasure ship . <\s>
<s> Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island 's despot Isaac Komnenos . <\s>
<s> On 1 May 1191 , Richard 's fleet arrived in the port of Limassol on Cyprus . <\s>
<s> He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure . <\s>
<s> Isaac refused , so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol . <\s>
<s> Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time , in particular Guy de Lusignan . <\s>
<s> All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival Conrad of Montferrat . <\s>
<s> The local barons abandoned Isaac , who considered making peace with Richard , joining him on the crusade , and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard . <\s>
<s> But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape . <\s>
<s> Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island , his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan . <\s>
<s> Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains , because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons . <\s>
<s> By 1 June , Richard had conquered the whole island . <\s>
<s> His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation ; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island . <\s>
<s> Richard left for Acre on 5 June , with his allies . <\s>
<s> Before his departure , he named two of his Norman generals , Richard de Camville and Robert de Thornham , as governors of Cyprus . <\s>
<s> Between 1402 and 1405 , the expedition led by the Norman noble Jean de Bethencourt and the Poitevine Gadifer de la Salle conquered the Canarian islands of Lanzarote , Fuerteventura and El Hierro off the Atlantic coast of Africa . <\s>
<s> Their troops were gathered in Normandy , Gascony and were later reinforced by Castilian colonists . <\s>
<s> Bethencourt took the title of King of the Canary Islands , as vassal to Henry III of Castile . <\s>
<s> In 1418 , Jean 's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán , 2nd Count de Niebla . <\s>
<s> The customary law of Normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands . <\s>
<s> Norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in Latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues : These are the Très ancien coutumier , authored between 1200 and 1245 ; and the Grand coutumier de Normandie , authored between 1235 and 1245 . <\s>
<s> Norman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued . <\s>
<s> They spread a unique Romanesque idiom to England and Italy , and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape . <\s>
<s> Their style was characterised by rounded arches , particularly over windows and doorways , and massive proportions . <\s>
<s> In England , the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the Anglo-Saxon and precedes the Early Gothic . <\s>
<s> In southern Italy , the Normans incorporated elements of Islamic , Lombard , and Byzantine building techniques into their own , initiating a unique style known as Norman-Arab architecture within the Kingdom of Sicily . <\s>
<s> In the visual arts , the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered . <\s>
<s> However , in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform , encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits , especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts . <\s>
<s> The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy . <\s>
<s> The chief monasteries taking part in this `` renaissance '' of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel , Fécamp , Jumièges , Bec , Saint-Ouen , Saint-Evroul , and Saint-Wandrille . <\s>
<s> These centres were in contact with the so-called `` Winchester school '' , which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy . <\s>
<s> In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century , Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts , but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century . <\s>
<s> The French Wars of Religion in the 16th century and French Revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity . <\s>
<s> The former , with their violence , caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices ; the latter , with its assault on religion , caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type , and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging . <\s>
<s> By far the most famous work of Norman art is the Bayeux Tapestry , which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery . <\s>
<s> It was commissioned by Odo , the Bishop of Bayeux and first Earl of Kent , employing natives from Kent who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the Danish Vikings . <\s>
<s> In Britain , Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork , such as capitals and baptismal fonts . <\s>
<s> In southern Italy , however , Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek , Lombard , and Arab forebears . <\s>
<s> Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo , the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions . <\s>
<s> Many churches preserve sculptured fonts , capitals , and more importantly mosaics , which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage . <\s>
<s> Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination . <\s>
<s> Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins . <\s>
<s> For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces . <\s>
<s> Normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century . <\s>
<s> Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education . <\s>
<s> At Fécamp , under two Italian abbots , William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna , the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught . <\s>
<s> It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today . <\s>
<s> Also at Fécamp , the staff , around which neumes were oriented , was first developed and taught in the 11th century . <\s>
<s> Under the German abbot Isembard , La Trinité-du-Mont became a centre of musical composition . <\s>
<s> At Saint Evroul , a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy . <\s>
<s> Under the Norman abbot Robert de Grantmesnil , several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy , where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at Sant ' Eufemia . <\s>
<s> There they continued the tradition of singing . <\s>
<s> Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other . <\s>
<s> A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer , which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps , such as an algorithm . <\s>
<s> A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources , whatever the algorithm used . <\s>
<s> The theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them , such as time and storage . <\s>
<s> Other complexity measures are also used , such as the amount of communication , the number of gates in a circuit and the number of processors . <\s>
<s> One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and can not do . <\s>
<s> Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory . <\s>
<s> A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem . <\s>
<s> More precisely , it tries to classify problems that can or can not be solved with appropriately restricted resources . <\s>
<s> In turn , imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory : the latter theory asks what kind of problems can , in principle , be solved algorithmically . <\s>
<s> A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance . <\s>
<s> The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself . <\s>
<s> In computational complexity theory , a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved . <\s>
<s> In contrast , an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance , which can serve as the input for a decision problem . <\s>
<s> For example , consider the problem of primality testing . <\s>
<s> The instance is a number and the solution is `` yes '' if the number is prime and `` no '' otherwise . <\s>
<s> Stated another way , the instance is a particular input to the problem , and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input . <\s>
<s> When considering computational problems , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet . <\s>
<s> Usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet , and thus the strings are bitstrings . <\s>
<s> As in a real-world computer , mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded . <\s>
<s> For example , integers can be represented in binary notation , and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices , or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary . <\s>
<s> Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory . <\s>
<s> A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0 . <\s>
<s> A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes , and the non-members are those instances whose output is no . <\s>
<s> The objective is to decide , with the aid of an algorithm , whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration . <\s>
<s> If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes , the algorithm is said to accept the input string , otherwise it is said to reject the input . <\s>
<s> An example of a decision problem is the following . <\s>
<s> The input is an arbitrary graph . <\s>
<s> The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected , or not . <\s>
<s> The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — of course , to obtain a precise definition of this language , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings . <\s>
<s> A function problem is a computational problem where a single output is expected for every input , but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem , that is , it is n't just yes or no . <\s>
<s> Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem . <\s>
<s> It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems . <\s>
<s> However , this is not really the case , since function problems can be recast as decision problems . <\s>
<s> For example , the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples such that the relation a × b = c holds . <\s>
<s> Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers . <\s>
<s> To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem , one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem . <\s>
<s> However , the running time may , in general , depend on the instance . <\s>
<s> In particular , larger instances will require more time to solve . <\s>
<s> Thus the time required to solve a problem is calculated as a function of the size of the instance . <\s>
<s> This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits . <\s>
<s> Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size . <\s>
<s> For instance , in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected , how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices ? <\s>
<s> If the input size is n , the time taken can be expressed as a function of n . <\s>
<s> Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n . <\s>
<s> If T(n) is a polynomial in n , then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm . <\s>
<s> Cobham 's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm . <\s>
<s> A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine . <\s>
<s> It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape . <\s>
<s> Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology , but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine — anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper . <\s>
<s> It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm , there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem . <\s>
<s> Indeed , this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today , such as a RAM machine , Conway 's Game of Life , cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine . <\s>
<s> Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically , and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation , the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory . <\s>
<s> A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine , which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions . <\s>
<s> A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits . <\s>
<s> The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently . <\s>
<s> Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms . <\s>
<s> A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism , which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state . <\s>
<s> One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step , and if it solves the problem in any of these branches , it is said to have solved the problem . <\s>
<s> Clearly , this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model , it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes . <\s>
<s> For examples , see non-deterministic algorithm . <\s>
<s> Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic Turing machines , probabilistic Turing machines , non-deterministic Turing machines , quantum Turing machines , symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines . <\s>
<s> They are all equally powerful in principle , but when resources are bounded , some of these may be more powerful than others . <\s>
<s> Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature , for example random access machines . <\s>
<s> Perhaps surprisingly , each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power . <\s>
<s> The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary . <\s>
<s> What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically . <\s>
<s> However , some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources . <\s>
<s> For example , a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once . <\s>
<s> The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems . <\s>
<s> For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space , a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used . <\s>
<s> The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions , or steps , the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer . <\s>
<s> A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n) , if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n) . <\s>
<s> A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem . <\s>
<s> Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty , one defines sets of problems based on some criteria . <\s>
<s> For instance , the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)) . <\s>
<s> Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements . <\s>
<s> Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources , any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource . <\s>
<s> Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms . <\s>
<s> Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity , circuit complexity , and decision tree complexity . <\s>
<s> The best , worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity of different inputs of the same size . <\s>
<s> Since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others , we define the following complexities . <\s>
<s> For example , consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort . <\s>
<s> This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input . <\s>
<s> The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order , and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case . <\s>
<s> If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely , the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n) . <\s>
<s> The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half , also needing O(n log n) time . <\s>
<s> To classify the computation time , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem . <\s>
<s> The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity , unless specified otherwise . <\s>
<s> Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms . <\s>
<s> To show an upper bound T(n) on the time complexity of a problem , one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T(n) . <\s>
<s> However , proving lower bounds is much more difficult , since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem . <\s>
<s> The phrase `` all possible algorithms '' includes not just the algorithms known today , but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future . <\s>
<s> To show a lower bound of T(n) for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than T(n) . <\s>
<s> Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big O notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms . <\s>
<s> This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used . <\s>
<s> For instance , if T(n) = 7n2 + 15n + 40 , in big O notation one would write T(n) = O(n2) . <\s>
<s> Of course , some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework . <\s>
<s> Thus , a typical complexity class has a definition like the following . <\s>
<s> But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model . <\s>
<s> For instance , the language can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine , but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines . <\s>
<s> If we allow polynomial variations in running time , Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that `` the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related '' . <\s>
<s> This forms the basis for the complexity class P , which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time . <\s>
<s> The corresponding set of function problems is FP . <\s>
<s> Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm . <\s>
<s> Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following . <\s>
<s> Other important complexity classes include BPP , ZPP and RP , which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines ; AC and NC , which are defined using Boolean circuits ; and BQP and QMA , which are defined using quantum Turing machines . <\s>
<s> # P is an important complexity class of counting problems . <\s>
<s> Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems . <\s>
<s> ALL is the class of all decision problems . <\s>
<s> For the complexity classes defined in this way , it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems . <\s>
<s> In particular , although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2) , it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict . <\s>
<s> For time and space requirements , the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively . <\s>
<s> They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources . <\s>
<s> Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other . <\s>
<s> Having deduced such proper set inclusions , we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved . <\s>
<s> The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes . <\s>
<s> For instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE . <\s>
<s> Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction . <\s>
<s> A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem . <\s>
<s> It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem . <\s>
<s> For instance , if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y , X is no more difficult than Y , and we say that X reduces to Y . <\s>
<s> There are many different types of reductions , based on the method of reduction , such as Cook reductions , Karp reductions and Levin reductions , and the bound on the complexity of reductions , such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions . <\s>
<s> The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction . <\s>
<s> This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time . <\s>
<s> For example , the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers . <\s>
<s> This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer . <\s>
<s> Indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm . <\s>
<s> Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication , since squaring can be reduced to multiplication . <\s>
<s> This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class . <\s>
<s> A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X . <\s>
<s> Thus no problem in C is harder than X , since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C . <\s>
<s> Of course , the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used . <\s>
<s> For complexity classes larger than P , polynomial-time reductions are commonly used . <\s>
<s> In particular , the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems . <\s>
<s> If a problem X is in C and hard for C , then X is said to be complete for C . <\s>
<s> This means that X is the hardest problem in C . <\s>
<s> Since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C . <\s>
<s> Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P . <\s>
<s> Because the problem P = NP is not solved , being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem , Π2 , to another problem , Π1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1 . <\s>
<s> This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2 . <\s>
<s> Similarly , because all NP problems can be reduced to the set , finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP . <\s>
<s> The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm . <\s>
<s> This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis . <\s>
<s> The complexity class NP , on the other hand , contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently , but for which no efficient algorithm is known , such as the Boolean satisfiability problem , the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem . <\s>
<s> Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines , it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP . <\s>
<s> The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution . <\s>
<s> If the answer is yes , many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions . <\s>
<s> These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research , many problems in logistics , protein structure prediction in biology , and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems . <\s>
<s> The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute . <\s>
<s> There is a US $ 1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem . <\s>
<s> It was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete . <\s>
<s> Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems . <\s>
<s> The graph isomorphism problem , the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate . <\s>
<s> They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete . <\s>
<s> The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic . <\s>
<s> An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P , NP-complete , or NP-intermediate . <\s>
<s> The answer is not known , but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete . <\s>
<s> If graph isomorphism is NP-complete , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level . <\s>
<s> Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level , it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete . <\s>
<s> The best algorithm for this problem , due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks has run time 2O(√(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices . <\s>
<s> The integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer . <\s>
<s> Phrased as a decision problem , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k . <\s>
<s> No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems , such as the RSA algorithm . <\s>
<s> The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP . <\s>
<s> If the problem is NP-complete , the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level . <\s>
<s> The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve , which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer . <\s>
<s> However , the best known quantum algorithm for this problem , Shor 's algorithm , does run in polynomial time . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , this fact does n't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes . <\s>
<s> Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal , but this has not been proved . <\s>
<s> For instance P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE , but it is possible that P = PSPACE . <\s>
<s> If P is not equal to NP , then P is not equal to PSPACE either . <\s>
<s> Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE , such as RP , BPP , PP , BQP , MA , PH , etc. , it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class . <\s>
<s> Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory . <\s>
<s> Along the same lines , co-NP is the class containing the complement problems of NP problems . <\s>
<s> It is believed that NP is not equal to co-NP ; however , it has not yet been proven . <\s>
<s> It has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP . <\s>
<s> Similarly , it is not known if L is strictly contained in P or equal to P . <\s>
<s> Again , there are many complexity classes between the two , such as NL and NC , and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes . <\s>
<s> Problems that can be solved in theory , but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful , are known as intractable problems . <\s>
<s> In complexity theory , problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs . <\s>
<s> In fact , the Cobham–Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device . <\s>
<s> Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard . <\s>
<s> If NP is not the same as P , then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense . <\s>
<s> To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice , consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting . <\s>
<s> For small n , say 100 , and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second , the program would run for about 4 × 1010 years , which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe . <\s>
<s> Even with a much faster computer , the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical . <\s>
<s> If its running time is , say , n15 , it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances . <\s>
<s> What intractability means in practice is open to debate . <\s>
<s> Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are . <\s>
<s> For example , the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases . <\s>
<s> Similarly , algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem . <\s>
<s> Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off , numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers . <\s>
<s> Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1936 , which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer . <\s>
<s> As Fortnow & Homer point out , the beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal paper `` On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms '' by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns , which laid out the definitions of time and space complexity and proved the hierarchy theorems . <\s>
<s> Also , in 1965 Edmonds defined a `` good '' algorithm as one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size . <\s>
<s> Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include John Myhill 's definition of linear bounded automata , Raymond Smullyan 's study of rudimentary sets , as well as Hisao Yamada 's paper on real-time computations . <\s>
<s> Somewhat earlier , Boris Trakhtenbrot , a pioneer in the field from the USSR , studied another specific complexity measure . <\s>
<s> Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding , one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding . <\s>
<s> This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently . <\s>
<s> In 1967 , Manuel Blum developed an axiomatic complexity theory based on his axioms and proved an important result , the so-called , speed-up theorem . <\s>
<s> The field really began to flourish in 1971 when the US researcher Stephen Cook and , working independently , Leonid Levin in the USSR , proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete . <\s>
<s> In 1972 , Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper , `` Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems '' , in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems , each infamous for its computational intractability , are NP-complete . <\s>
<s> Southern California , often abbreviated SoCal , is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California 's southernmost 10 counties . <\s>
<s> The region is traditionally described as `` eight counties '' , based on demographics and economic ties : Imperial , Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino , San Diego , Santa Barbara , and Ventura . <\s>
<s> The more extensive 10-county definition , including Kern and San Luis Obispo counties , is also used based on historical political divisions . <\s>
<s> Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States . <\s>
<s> The 8- and 10-county definitions are not used for the greater Southern California Megaregion , one of the 11 megaregions of the United States . <\s>
<s> The megaregion 's area is more expansive , extending east into Las Vegas , Nevada , and south across the Mexican border into Tijuana . <\s>
<s> Southern California includes the heavily built-up urban area stretching along the Pacific coast from Ventura , through the Greater Los Angeles Area and the Inland Empire , and down to Greater San Diego . <\s>
<s> Southern California 's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas , or MSAs : the Los Angeles metropolitan area , consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties ; the Inland Empire , consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties ; the San Diego metropolitan area ; the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura metropolitan area ; the Santa Barbara metro area ; the San Luis Obispo metropolitan area ; and the El Centro area . <\s>
<s> Out of these , three are heavy populated areas : the Los Angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants , the Riverside-San Bernardino area with over four million inhabitants , and the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants . <\s>
<s> For CSA metropolitan purposes , the five counties of Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino , and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people . <\s>
<s> With over 22 million people , southern California contains roughly 60 percent of California 's population . <\s>
<s> To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River at the border with Arizona , and the Mojave Desert at the border with the state of Nevada . <\s>
<s> To the south is the Mexico–United States border . <\s>
<s> Within southern California are two major cities , Los Angeles and San Diego , as well as three of the country 's largest metropolitan areas . <\s>
<s> With a population of 3,792,621 , Los Angeles is the most populous city in California and the second most populous in the United States . <\s>
<s> To the south and with a population of 1,307,402 is San Diego , the second most populous city in the state and the eighth most populous in the nation . <\s>
<s> Its counties of Los Angeles , Orange , San Diego , San Bernardino , and Riverside are the five most populous in the state and all are in the top 15 most populous counties in the United States . <\s>
<s> The motion picture , television , and music industry is centered on the Los Angeles in southern California . <\s>
<s> Hollywood , a district within Los Angeles , is also a name associated with the motion picture industry . <\s>
<s> Headquartered in southern California are The Walt Disney Company , Sony Pictures , Universal , MGM , Paramount Pictures , 20th Century Fox , and Warner Brothers . <\s>
<s> Universal , Warner Brothers , and Sony also run major record companies as well . <\s>
<s> Southern California is also home to a large home grown surf and skateboard culture . <\s>
<s> Companies such as Volcom , Quiksilver , No Fear , RVCA , and Body Glove are all headquartered here . <\s>
<s> Professional skateboarder Tony Hawk , professional surfers Rob Machado , Tim Curran , Bobby Martinez , Pat O ' Connell , Dane Reynolds , and Chris Ward , and professional snowboarder Shaun White live in southern California . <\s>
<s> Some of the world 's legendary surf spots are in southern California as well , including Trestles , Rincon , The Wedge , Huntington Beach , and Malibu , and it is second only to the island of Oahu in terms of famous surf breaks . <\s>
<s> Some of the world 's biggest extreme sports events , including the X Games , Boost Mobile Pro , and the U.S. Open of Surfing are all in southern California . <\s>
<s> Southern California is also important to the world of yachting . <\s>
<s> The annual Transpacific Yacht Race , or Transpac , from Los Angeles to Hawaii , is one of yachting 's premier events . <\s>
<s> The San Diego Yacht Club held the America 's Cup , the most prestigious prize in yachting , from 1988 to 1995 and hosted three America 's Cup races during that time . <\s>
<s> Many locals and tourists frequent the southern California coast for its popular beaches , and the desert city of Palm Springs is popular for its resort feel and nearby open spaces . <\s>
<s> `` Southern California '' is not a formal geographic designation , and definitions of what constitutes southern California vary . <\s>
<s> Geographically , California 's north-south midway point lies at exactly 37 ° 9 ' 58.23 " latitude , around 11 miles south of San Jose ; however , this does not coincide with popular use of the term . <\s>
<s> When the state is divided into two areas , the term `` southern California '' usually refers to the ten southern-most counties of the state . <\s>
<s> This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35 ° 47 ' 28 " north latitude , which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo , Kern , and San Bernardino counties . <\s>
<s> Another definition for southern California uses Point Conception and the Tehachapi Mountains as the northern boundary . <\s>
<s> Though there is no official definition for the northern boundary of southern California , such a division has existed from the time when Mexico ruled California , and political disputes raged between the Californios of Monterey in the upper part and Los Angeles in the lower part of Alta California . <\s>
<s> Following the acquisition of California by the United States , the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro-slavery politicians to arrange the division of Alta California at 36 degrees , 30 minutes , the line of the Missouri Compromise . <\s>
<s> Instead , the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state , preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state . <\s>
<s> Subsequently , Californios and pro-slavery southerners in the lightly populated `` Cow Counties '' of southern California attempted three times in the 1850s to achieve a separate statehood or territorial status separate from Northern California . <\s>
<s> The last attempt , the Pico Act of 1859 , was passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the State governor John B. Weller . <\s>
<s> It was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 75 % of voters in the proposed Territory of Colorado . <\s>
<s> This territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger Tulare County and San Luis Obispo County . <\s>
<s> The proposal was sent to Washington , D.C. with a strong advocate in Senator Milton Latham . <\s>
<s> However , the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote . <\s>
<s> In 1900 , the Los Angeles Times defined southern California as including `` the seven counties of Los Angeles , San Bernardino , Orange , Riverside , San Diego , Ventura and Santa Barbara . '' <\s>
<s> In 1999 , the Times added a newer county — Imperial — to that list . <\s>
<s> The state is most commonly divided and promoted by its regional tourism groups as consisting of northern , central , and southern California regions . <\s>
<s> The two AAA Auto Clubs of the state , the California State Automobile Association and the Automobile Club of Southern California , choose to simplify matters by dividing the state along the lines where their jurisdictions for membership apply , as either northern or southern California , in contrast to the three-region point of view . <\s>
<s> Another influence is the geographical phrase South of the Tehachapis , which would split the southern region off at the crest of that transverse range , but in that definition , the desert portions of north Los Angeles County and eastern Kern and San Bernardino Counties would be included in the southern California region due to their remoteness from the central valley and interior desert landscape . <\s>
<s> Southern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment , home to some of the largest urban areas in the state , along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped . <\s>
<s> It is the third most populated megalopolis in the United States , after the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the Northeastern megalopolis . <\s>
<s> Much of southern California is famous for its large , spread-out , suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways . <\s>
<s> The dominant areas are Los Angeles , Orange County , San Diego , and Riverside-San Bernardino , each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area , composed of numerous smaller cities and communities . <\s>
<s> The urban area is also host to an international metropolitan region in the form of San Diego–Tijuana , created by the urban area spilling over into Baja California . <\s>
<s> Traveling south on Interstate 5 , the main gap to continued urbanization is Camp Pendleton . <\s>
<s> The cities and communities along Interstate 15 and Interstate 215 are so inter-related that Temecula and Murrieta have as much connection with the San Diego metropolitan area as they do with the Inland Empire . <\s>
<s> To the east , the United States Census Bureau considers the San Bernardino and Riverside County areas , Riverside-San Bernardino area as a separate metropolitan area from Los Angeles County . <\s>
<s> While many commute to L.A. and Orange Counties , there are some differences in development , as most of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties were developed in the 1980s and 1990s . <\s>
<s> Newly developed exurbs formed in the Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles , the Victor Valley and the Coachella Valley with the Imperial Valley . <\s>
<s> Also , population growth was high in the Bakersfield-Kern County , Santa Maria and San Luis Obispo areas . <\s>
<s> Southern California contains a Mediterranean climate , with infrequent rain and many sunny days . <\s>
<s> Summers are hot and dry , while winters are a bit warm or mild and wet . <\s>
<s> Serious rain can occur unusually . <\s>
<s> In the summers , temperature ranges are 90-60 's while as winters are 70-50 's , usually all of Southern California have Mediterranean climate . <\s>
<s> But snow is very rare in the Southwest of the state , it occurs on the Southeast of the state . <\s>
<s> Southern California consists of one of the more varied collections of geologic , topographic , and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diversity outnumbering other major regions in the state and country . <\s>
<s> The region spans from Pacific Ocean islands , shorelines , beaches , and coastal plains , through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges with their peaks , into the large and small interior valleys , to the vast deserts of California . <\s>
<s> Each year , the southern California area has about 10,000 earthquakes . <\s>
<s> Nearly all of them are so small that they are not felt . <\s>
<s> Only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0 , and only about 15–20 are greater than magnitude 4.0 . <\s>
<s> The magnitude 6.7 1994 Northridge earthquake was particularly destructive , causing a substantial number of deaths , injuries , and structural collapses . <\s>
<s> It caused the most property damage of any earthquake in U.S. history , estimated at over $ 20 billion . <\s>
<s> Many faults are able to produce a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake , such as the San Andreas Fault , which can produce a magnitude 8.0 event . <\s>
<s> Other faults include the San Jacinto Fault , the Puente Hills Fault , and the Elsinore Fault Zone . <\s>
<s> The USGS has released a California Earthquake forecast which models Earthquake occurrence in California . <\s>
<s> Southern California is divided culturally , politically , and economically into distinctive regions , each containing its own culture and atmosphere , anchored usually by a city with both national and sometimes global recognition , which are often the hub of economic activity for its respective region and being home to many tourist destinations . <\s>
<s> Each region is further divided into many culturally distinct areas but as a whole combine to create the southern California atmosphere . <\s>
<s> As of the 2010 United States Census , southern California has a population of 22,680,010 . <\s>
<s> Despite a reputation for high growth rates , southern California 's rate grew less than the state average of 10.0 % in the 2000s as California 's growth became concentrated in the northern part of the state due to a stronger , tech-oriented economy in the Bay Area and an emerging Greater Sacramento region . <\s>
<s> Southern California consists of one Combined Statistical Area , eight Metropolitan Statistical Areas , one international metropolitan area , and multiple metropolitan divisions . <\s>
<s> The region is home to two extended metropolitan areas that exceed five million in population . <\s>
<s> These are the Greater Los Angeles Area at 17,786,419 , and San Diego–Tijuana at 5,105,768 . <\s>
<s> Of these metropolitan areas , the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan area , Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area , and Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura metropolitan area form Greater Los Angeles ; while the El Centro metropolitan area and San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos metropolitan area form the Southern Border Region . <\s>
<s> North of Greater Los Angeles are the Santa Barbara , San Luis Obispo , and Bakersfield metropolitan areas . <\s>
<s> Los Angeles and San Diego , both in southern California , are the two largest cities in all of California . <\s>
<s> In southern California there are also twelve cities with more than 200,000 residents and 34 cities over 100,000 in population . <\s>
<s> Many of southern California 's most developed cities lie along or in close proximity to the coast , with the exception of San Bernardino and Riverside . <\s>
<s> Southern California 's economy is diverse and one of the largest in the United States . <\s>
<s> It is dominated and heavily dependent upon abundance of petroleum , as opposed to other regions where automobiles not nearly as dominant , the vast majority of transport runs on this fuel . <\s>
<s> Southern California is famous for tourism and Hollywood . <\s>
<s> Other industries include software , automotive , ports , finance , tourism , biomedical , and regional logistics . <\s>
<s> The region was a leader in the housing bubble 2001–2007 , and has been heavily impacted by the housing crash . <\s>

<s> Six of the seven lines of the commuter rail system , Metrolink , run out of Downtown Los Angeles , connecting Los Angeles , Ventura , San Bernardino , Riverside , Orange , and San Diego counties with the other line connecting San Bernardino , Riverside , and Orange counties directly . <\s>
<s> Southern California is also home to the Port of Los Angeles , the United States ' busiest commercial port ; the adjacent Port of Long Beach , the United States ' second busiest container port ; and the Port of San Diego . <\s>
<s> The Tech Coast is a moniker that has gained use as a descriptor for the region 's diversified technology and industrial base as well as its multitude of prestigious and world-renowned research universities and other public and private institutions . <\s>

<s> Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting , BSkyB became the UK 's largest digital subscription television company . <\s>
<s> Following BSkyB 's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04 % interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014 , its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc . <\s>
<s> The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited , still trading as Sky . <\s>
<s> Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission , which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer , BSkyB 's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season . <\s>
<s> In May 2006 , the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters . <\s>
<s> Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn . <\s>
<s> In February 2015 , Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016 . <\s>
<s> This represented an increase of 70 % on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay . <\s>
<s> The move has been followed by staff cuts , increased subscription prices and the dropping of the 3D channel . <\s>
<s> While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium , thereby making them a competitor by default , BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital 's free-to-air replacement , Freeview , in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC , ITV , Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless . <\s>
<s> Prior to October 2005 , three BSkyB channels were available on this platform : Sky News , Sky Three , and Sky Sports News . <\s>
<s> Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service . <\s>
<s> However , this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005 , which was itself later re-branded as ' Pick TV ' in 2011 . <\s>
<s> BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . <\s>
<s> This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge . <\s>
<s> Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions . <\s>
<s> In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+ . <\s>
<s> In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality . <\s>
<s> In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women . <\s>
<s> As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users . <\s>
<s> BSkyB utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS , a Cisco Systems company . <\s>
<s> There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders ; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs . <\s>
<s> BSkyB has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service . <\s>
<s> The receivers , though designed and built by different manufacturers , must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others . <\s>
<s> This extends to the Personal video recorder offering . <\s>
<s> In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV . <\s>
<s> The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007 . <\s>
<s> Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels , a claim which BSkyB denied , on the basis that their new deal offered `` substantially more value '' by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable . <\s>
<s> In July 2013 , the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft 's use of the term `` SkyDrive '' infringed on Sky 's right to the `` Sky '' trademark . <\s>
<s> On 31 July 2013 , BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement , in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling , and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified `` reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand , '' plus `` financial and other terms , the details of which are confidential '' . <\s>
<s> On 27 January 2014 , Microsoft announced `` that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive '' and `` SkyDrive Pro '' becomes `` OneDrive for Business '' . <\s>
<s> The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . <\s>
<s> The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . <\s>
<s> The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . <\s>
<s> Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . <\s>
<s> Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . <\s>
<s> Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels . <\s>
<s> Sky UK Limited is a British telecommunications company which serves the United Kingdom . <\s>
<s> Sky provides television and broadband internet services and fixed line telephone services to consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom . <\s>
<s> It is the UK 's largest pay-TV broadcaster with 11 million customers as of 2015 . <\s>
<s> It was the UK 's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by Freeview in April 2007 . <\s>
<s> Its corporate headquarters are based in Isleworth . <\s>
<s> On 18 November 2015 , Sky announced Sky Q , a range of products and services to be available in 2016 . <\s>
<s> The Sky Q range consists of three set top boxes , a broadband router and mobile applications . <\s>
<s> The Sky Q set top boxes introduce a new user interface , Wi-Fi hotspot functionality , Power-line and Bluetooth connectivity and a new touch-sensitive remote control . <\s>
<s> The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to the Sky Q Silver set top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds . <\s>
<s> This allows all set top boxes in a household to share recordings and other media . <\s>
<s> The Sky Q Silver set top box is capable of receiving and displaying UHD broadcasts , which Sky will introduce later in 2016 . <\s>
<s> BSkyB 's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2 , with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films , although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box . <\s>
<s> Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard . <\s>
<s> Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system , with set-top boxes including modems for a return path . <\s>
<s> Sky News , amongst other channels , provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams . <\s>
<s> When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position , unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E . <\s>
<s> This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat 's Eurobird 1 at 28.5°E , enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service , Sky , with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels . <\s>
<s> The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries , while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom . <\s>
<s> BSkyB launched its HDTV service , Sky+ HD , on 22 May 2006 . <\s>
<s> Prior to its launch , BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service . <\s>
<s> In the week before the launch , rumours started to surface that BSkyB was having supply issues with its set top box from manufacturer Thomson . <\s>
<s> On Thursday 18 May 2006 , and continuing through the weekend before launch , people were reporting that BSkyB had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation . <\s>
<s> Finally , the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries . <\s>
<s> On 31 March 2012 , Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+HD was 4,222,000 . <\s>
<s> On 8 February 2007 , BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels . <\s>
<s> It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport , films , entertainment and news . <\s>
<s> The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform , and on the same day that NTL 's services re-branded as Virgin Media . <\s>
<s> However , industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels , due to possible lost advertising revenue . <\s>
<s> Provided is a universal Ku band LNB which is fitted at the end of the dish and pointed at the correct satellite constellation ; most digital receivers will receive the free to air channels . <\s>
<s> Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted , some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription , some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription , and some are pay-per-view services . <\s>
<s> To view the encrypted content a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver needs to be used . <\s>
<s> Unofficial CAMs are now available to view the service , although use of them breaks the user 's contract with Sky and invalidates the user 's rights to use the card . <\s>
<s> In the autumn of 1991 , talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period , from the 1992 season . <\s>
<s> ITV were the current rights holders , and fought hard to retain the new rights . <\s>
<s> ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights . <\s>
<s> BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid . <\s>
<s> The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches , while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights , would give them a monopoly of all live matches , up to 60 per year from the 1992 season . <\s>
<s> Murdoch described sport as a `` battering ram '' for pay-television , providing a strong customer base . <\s>
<s> A few weeks after the deal , ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken . <\s>
<s> ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch 's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal . <\s>
<s> A few days later neither action took effect , ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid , and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid . <\s>
<s> BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG , with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from Ofcom . <\s>
<s> Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to BSkyB 's EPG for a fee , ranging from £15–100,000 . <\s>
<s> Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries , free carriage on a BSkyB leased transponder , or actual payment for being carried . <\s>
<s> However , even in this case , BSkyB does not carry any control over the channel 's content or carriage issues such as picture quality . <\s>
<s> BSkyB 's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital , although small-scale tests were carried out before then . <\s>
<s> At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky 's analogue services . <\s>
<s> Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality , increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open now called Sky Active , BSkyB competed with the ONdigital terrestrial offering and cable services . <\s>
<s> Within 30 days , over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold , which help bolstered BSkyB 's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999 . <\s>
<s> Virgin Media started to offer a high-definition television capable set top box , although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel , BBC HD , after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial . <\s>
<s> Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were `` locked up '' or otherwise withheld from their platform , although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless , the linear channels were not offered , Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content . <\s>
<s> Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years , suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way . <\s>
<s> BSkyB 's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010 , Europe 's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone . <\s>
<s> Confirming it had reached its target , the broadcaster said its reach into 36 % of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people . <\s>
<s> The target was first announced in August 2004 , since then an additional 2.4 million customers had subscribed to BSkyB 's direct-to-home service . <\s>
<s> Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened . <\s>
<s> The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government 's benefits agency was checking claimants ' `` Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone '' – as , it claimed , subscription to sports channels would betray a man 's presence in the household . <\s>
<s> In December , the UK 's parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was often damaging , along with alcohol , tobacco and gambling . <\s>
<s> Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a `` Welfare Cash Card '' , in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , that could be used to buy only `` essentials '' . <\s>
<s> The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets . <\s>
<s> Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by BSkyB . <\s>
<s> As part of the agreements , both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels . <\s>
<s> The economy of Victoria is highly diversified : service sectors including financial and property services , health , education , wholesale , retail , hospitality and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment . <\s>
<s> Victoria 's total gross state product is ranked second in Australia , although Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity . <\s>
<s> Culturally , Melbourne is home to a number of museums , art galleries and theatres and is also described as the `` sporting capital of Australia '' . <\s>
<s> The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium in Australia , and the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games . <\s>
<s> The ground is also considered the `` spiritual home '' of Australian cricket and Australian rules football , and hosts the grand final of the Australian Football League each year , usually drawing crowds of over 95,000 people . <\s>
<s> Victoria includes eight public universities , with the oldest , the University of Melbourne , having been founded in 1853 . <\s>
<s> Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold , especially from Ireland and China . <\s>
<s> Many Chinese miners worked in Victoria , and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs . <\s>
<s> Although there was some racism directed at them , there was not the level of anti-Chinese violence that was seen at the Lambing Flat riots in New South Wales . <\s>
<s> However , there was a riot at Buckland Valley near Bright in 1857 . <\s>
<s> Conditions on the gold fields were cramped and unsanitary ; an outbreak of typhoid at Buckland Valley in 1854 killed over 1,000 miners . <\s>
<s> In November 2006 , the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system . <\s>
<s> The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by Single Transferable Vote . <\s>
<s> The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members — four years . <\s>
<s> Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years . <\s>
<s> Prior to the 2006 election , the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates . <\s>
<s> The centre-left Australian Labor Party , the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia , the rural-based National Party of Australia , and the environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria 's main political parties . <\s>
<s> Traditionally , Labor is strongest in Melbourne 's working class western and northern suburbs , and the regional cities of Ballarat , Bendigo and Geelong . <\s>
<s> The Liberals ' main support lies in Melbourne 's more affluent eastern and outer suburbs , and some rural and regional centres . <\s>
<s> The Nationals are strongest in Victoria 's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas . <\s>
<s> The Greens , who won their first lower house seats in 2014 , are strongest in inner Melbourne . <\s>
<s> About 61.1 % of Victorians describe themselves as Christian . <\s>
<s> Roman Catholics form the single largest religious group in the state with 26.7 % of the Victorian population , followed by Anglicans and members of the Uniting Church . <\s>

<s> After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788 , Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named New Holland , under the administration of the colonial government in Sydney . <\s>
<s> The first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor David Collins at Sullivan Bay on Port Phillip . <\s>
<s> It consisted of 402 people . <\s>
<s> They had been sent from England in HMS Calcutta under the command of Captain Daniel Woodriff , principally out of fear that the French , who had been exploring the area , might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent . <\s>
<s> In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against mining taxes . <\s>
<s> This was crushed by British troops , but the discontents prompted colonial authorities to reform the administration and extend the franchise . <\s>
<s> Within a short time , the Imperial Parliament granted Victoria responsible government with the passage of the Colony of Victoria Act 1855 . <\s>
<s> Some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion went on to become members of the Victorian Parliament . <\s>
<s> The Premier of Victoria is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly . <\s>
<s> The Premier is the public face of government and , with cabinet , sets the legislative and political agenda . <\s>
<s> Cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament . <\s>
<s> It is responsible for managing areas of government that are not exclusively the Commonwealth 's , by the Australian Constitution , such as education , health and law enforcement . <\s>
<s> The current Premier of Victoria is Daniel Andrews . <\s>
<s> During 2003–04 , the gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17 % to $ 8.7 billion . <\s>
<s> This represented 24 % of national agricultural production total gross value . <\s>
<s> As of 2004 , an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres of Victorian land . <\s>
<s> This comprises more than 60 % of the state 's total land surface . <\s>
<s> Victorian farms range from small horticultural outfits to large-scale livestock and grain productions . <\s>
<s> A quarter of farmland is used to grow consumable crops . <\s>
<s> Major events also play a big part in tourism in Victoria , particularly cultural tourism and sports tourism . <\s>
<s> Most of these events are centred on Melbourne , but others occur in regional cities , such as the V8 Supercars and Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at Phillip Island , the Grand Annual Steeplechase at Warrnambool and the Australian International Airshow at Geelong and numerous local festivals such as the popular Port Fairy Folk Festival , Queenscliff Music Festival , Bells Beach SurfClassic and the Bright Autumn Festival . <\s>
<s> Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562 , concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France , about one-eighth the number of French Catholics . <\s>
<s> As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith , Catholic hostility grew , in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown . <\s>
<s> A series of religious conflicts followed , known as the Wars of Religion , fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598 . <\s>
<s> The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes , which granted the Huguenots substantial religious , political and military autonomy . <\s>
<s> A term used originally in derision , Huguenot has unclear origins . <\s>
<s> Various hypotheses have been promoted . <\s>
<s> The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time , using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten , referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse . <\s>
<s> Geneva was John Calvin 's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement . <\s>
<s> In Geneva , Hugues , though Catholic , was a leader of the `` Confederate Party '' , so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation . <\s>
<s> The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators involved in the Amboise plot of 1560 : a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise . <\s>
<s> The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss . <\s>
<s> Thus , Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot , a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France . <\s>
<s> The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France . <\s>
<s> The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the Protestant Reformation finally arrived . <\s>
<s> Around 1294 , a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest , Guyard de Moulin . <\s>
<s> A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript , by Jean de Rély , was printed in Paris in 1487 . <\s>
<s> Montpellier was among the most important of the 66 `` villes de sûreté '' that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots . <\s>
<s> The city 's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots . <\s>
<s> Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622 . <\s>
<s> Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city 's fortifications . <\s>
<s> A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party . <\s>
<s> Even before the Edict of Alès , Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more . <\s>
<s> Individual Huguenots settled at the Cape of Good Hope from as early as 1671 with the arrival of François Villion . <\s>
<s> The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Queillerie , wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck , who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town . <\s>
<s> The couple left for the Far East ten years later . <\s>
<s> On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope . <\s>
<s> The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration , but quite a few arrived as late as 1700 ; thereafter , the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time . <\s>
<s> Barred by the government from settling in New France , Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest , sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland ; as well as Great Britain 's colonies , including Nova Scotia . <\s>
<s> A number of New Amsterdam 's families were of Huguenot origin , often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century . <\s>
<s> In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L ' Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam . <\s>
<s> This parish continues today as L ' Eglise du Saint-Esprit , part of the Episcopal communion , and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world . <\s>
<s> Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam , Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek , becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn , then known as Boschwick , in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick . <\s>
<s> In the early years , many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston , South Carolina . <\s>
<s> In 1685 , Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France , was among the first to settle there . <\s>
<s> He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city . <\s>
<s> After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 , several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent , including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne , Jean Postell of Dieppe France , Alexander Pepin , Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France , and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble , immigrated to the Charleston Orange district . <\s>
<s> They were very successful at marriage and property speculation . <\s>
<s> After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies , they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper , Ashepoo , Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger . <\s>
<s> Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas , where they developed new plantations . <\s>
<s> Stadtholder William III of Orange , who later became King of England , emerged as the strongest opponent of king Louis XIV after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672 . <\s>
<s> William formed the League of Augsburg as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state . <\s>
<s> Consequently , many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic , which led the opposition to Louis XIV , as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes . <\s>
<s> They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there . <\s>
<s> Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat . <\s>
<s> They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV , who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau , which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France , and forced the Huguenots to convert . <\s>
<s> While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed or submitted , roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century . <\s>
<s> The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots . <\s>
<s> Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship . <\s>
<s> The height of this persecution was the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed , although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well , as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France . <\s>
<s> Retaliating against the French Catholics , the Huguenots had their own militia . <\s>
<s> By 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive , and the government increasingly applied pressure . <\s>
<s> A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out , mainly in southwestern France , between 1621 and 1629 . <\s>
<s> Revolted against royal authority . <\s>
<s> The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV , a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism , who had protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes . <\s>
<s> His successor Louis XIII , under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de ' Medici , became more intolerant of Protestantism . <\s>
<s> The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures , establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers , and openly revolting against central power . <\s>
<s> The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown . <\s>
<s> Approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2 % of its population . <\s>
<s> Most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the Cévennes mountain region in the south , who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day . <\s>
<s> A diaspora of French Australians still considers itself Huguenot , even after centuries of exile . <\s>
<s> Long integrated into Australian society , it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage , aided by the Society 's genealogical research services . <\s>
<s> Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country , but rather , formed three societies or congregations ; one in the city of New York , another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named New Rochelle , and a third further upstate in New Paltz . <\s>
<s> The `` Huguenot Street Historic District '' in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America . <\s>
<s> A small group of Huguenots also settled on the south shore of Staten Island along the New York Harbor , for which the current neighborhood of Huguenot was named . <\s>
<s> After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees , an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people . <\s>
<s> Amongst them were 200 clergy . <\s>
<s> Many came from the region of the Cévennes , for instance , the village of Fraissinet-de-Lozère . <\s>
<s> This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time . <\s>
<s> Around 1700 , it is estimated that nearly 25 % of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot . <\s>
<s> In 1705 , Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants , followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715 . <\s>
<s> Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset . <\s>
<s> In this last connection , the name could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship ; popular fancy held that Huguon , the gate of King Hugo , was haunted by the ghost of le roi Huguet and other spirits , who instead of being in Purgatory came back to harm the living at night . <\s>
<s> It was in this place in Tours that the prétendus réformés habitually gathered at night , both for political purposes , and for prayer and singing psalms . <\s>
<s> Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary , Reguier de la Plancha , who in De l ' Estat de France offered the following account as to the origin of the name , as cited by The Cape Monthly . <\s>
<s> Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane , where weavers ' windows survive on the top floor , as many Huguenots worked as weavers . <\s>
<s> The Weavers , a half-timbered house by the river , was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830 . <\s>
<s> It has been adapted as a restaurant — see illustration above . <\s>
<s> The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century , reviving an earlier use . <\s>
<s> Others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population . <\s>
<s> Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees ' initial acceptance in the City . <\s>
<s> They also settled elsewhere in Kent , particularly Sandwich , Faversham and Maidstone — towns in which there used to be refugee churches . <\s>
<s> A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin , Cork , Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries . <\s>
<s> Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use , and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there . <\s>
<s> Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in Cork City ; and D ' Olier Street in Dublin , named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland . <\s>
<s> A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696 , and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town . <\s>
<s> At the time , they constituted the majority of the townspeople . <\s>
<s> The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain , as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society . <\s>
<s> The kingdom did not fully recover for years . <\s>
<s> The French crown 's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in New France may help to explain that colony 's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies , which opened settlement to religious dissenters . <\s>
<s> By the time of the French and Indian War , a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies , and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759-60 . <\s>
<s> The pattern of warfare , followed by brief periods of peace , continued for nearly another quarter-century . <\s>
<s> The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598 , when Henry of Navarre , having succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV , and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism , issued the Edict of Nantes . <\s>
<s> The Edict reaffirmed Catholicism as the state religion of France , but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains . <\s>
<s> The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions . <\s>
<s> The revocation forbade Protestant services , required education of children as Catholics , and prohibited emigration . <\s>
<s> It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France . <\s>
<s> It precipitated civil bloodshed , ruined commerce , and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants , many of whom became intellectuals , doctors and business leaders in Britain as well as Holland , Prussia , and South Africa . <\s>
<s> Four thousand emigrated to the North American colonies , where they settled in New York and Virginia , especially . <\s>
<s> The English welcomed the French refugees , providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation . <\s>
<s> Those Huguenots who stayed in France became Catholics and were called `` new converts '' . <\s>
<s> The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands . <\s>
<s> A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique . <\s>
<s> A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay , present-day Rio de Janeiro , and settled in a small island . <\s>
<s> A fort , named Fort Coligny , was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans . <\s>
<s> It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America . <\s>
<s> The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese , who captured part of the Huguenots . <\s>
<s> The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism . <\s>
<s> The Huguenots of Guanabara , as they are now known , produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese . <\s>
<s> This was their death sentence . <\s>
<s> This document , the Guanabara Confession of Faith , became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas . <\s>
<s> Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names . <\s>
<s> Many families , today mostly Afrikaans-speaking , have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry . <\s>
<s> Examples include : Blignaut , Cilliers , de Klerk , de Villiers , du Plessis , Du Preez , du Randt , du Toit , Duvenhage , Franck , Fouche , Fourie , Gervais , Giliomee , Gous/Gouws , Hugo , Jordaan , Joubert , Kriek , Labuschagne , le Roux , Lombard , Malan , Malherbe , Marais , Maree , Minnaar , Nel , Naude ' , Nortje , Pienaar , Retief , Rossouw , Taljaard , TerBlanche , Theron , Viljoen and Visagie . <\s>
<s> The wine industry in South Africa owes a significant debt to the Huguenots , some of whom had vineyards in France , or were brandy distillers , and used their skills in their new home . <\s>
<s> Paul Revere was descended from Huguenot refugees , as was Henry Laurens , who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina ; Jack Jouett , who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn Thomas Jefferson and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king ; Francis Marion , and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen . <\s>
<s> The last active Huguenot congregation in North America worships in Charleston , South Carolina , at a church that dates to 1844 . <\s>
<s> The Huguenot Society of America maintains Manakin Episcopal Church in Virginia as an historic shrine with occasional services . <\s>
<s> The Society has chapters in numerous states , with the one in Texas being the largest . <\s>
<s> Some Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire , one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time . <\s>
<s> Although 19th century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry , this is contentious . <\s>
<s> The only reference to immigrant lacemakers in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover , and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire . <\s>
<s> The implication that the style of lace known as ' Bucks Point ' demonstrates a Huguenot influence , being a `` combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground '' , is fallacious : what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century , when it was widely copied throughout Europe . <\s>
<s> In Berlin , the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods : Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt . <\s>
<s> By 1700 , one-fifth of the city 's population was French speaking . <\s>
<s> The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century . <\s>
<s> They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07 . <\s>
<s> Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence . <\s>
<s> Several congregations were founded , such as those of Fredericia , Berlin , Stockholm , Hamburg , Frankfurt , Helsinki , and Emden . <\s>
<s> After this , Huguenots fled to surrounding Protestant countries : England , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Norway , Denmark , and Prussia — whose Calvinist Great Elector Frederick William welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country . <\s>
<s> Following this exodus , Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France : the rugged Cévennes region in the south . <\s>
<s> In the early 18th century , a regional group known as the Camisards who were Huguenots rioted against the Catholic Church in the region , burning churches and killing clergy . <\s>
<s> It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards , between 1702 and 1709 . <\s>
<s> In 1564 a group of Norman Huguenots under the leadership of Jean Ribault established the small colony of Fort Caroline on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville , Florida . <\s>
<s> The effort was the first at any permanent European settlement in the present-day continental United States , but survived only a short time . <\s>
<s> A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at St. Augustine failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas . <\s>
<s> Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez . <\s>
<s> Menendez proceeded to massacre the defenseless Huguenots , after which he wiped out the Fort Caroline garrison . <\s>
<s> French Huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in North America . <\s>
<s> In 1562 , naval officer Jean Ribault led an expedition that explored Florida and the present-day Southeastern U.S. , and founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island , South Carolina . <\s>
<s> The Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage , and the outpost was abandoned . <\s>
<s> In 1564 , Ribault 's former lieutenant René Goulaine de Laudonnière launched a second voyage to build a colony ; he established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville , Florida . <\s>
<s> War at home again precluded a resupply mission , and the colony struggled . <\s>
<s> In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to La Florida , and sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés , who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline . <\s>
<s> Menéndez ' forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives . <\s>
<s> In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia , where the English Crown had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County . <\s>
<s> When they arrived , colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River , at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town , now in Powhatan County . <\s>
<s> Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County . <\s>
<s> On 12 May 1705 , the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown . <\s>
<s> Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement , many had died ; others lived outside town on farms in the English style ; and others moved to different areas . <\s>
<s> Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors . <\s>
<s> Through the 18th and 19th centuries , descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont , and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky , Tennessee , Missouri , and other states . <\s>
<s> In the Manakintown area , the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor , as were many local features , including several schools , including Huguenot High School . <\s>
<s> Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the Dutch Revolt . <\s>
<s> The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles . <\s>
<s> Early ties were already visible in the `` Apologie '' of William the Silent , condemning the Spanish Inquisition , which was written by his court minister , the Huguenot Pierre L ' Oyseleur , lord of Villiers . <\s>
<s> Louise de Coligny , daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny , married William the Silent , leader of the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule . <\s>
<s> As both spoke French in daily life , their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French . <\s>
<s> The practice has continued to the present day . <\s>
<s> The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church . <\s>
<s> The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic 's military and political leadership , the House of Orange-Nassau , which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt , helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic 's colonies . <\s>
<s> They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America . <\s>
<s> Both before and after the 1708 passage of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act , an estimated 50,000 Protestant Walloons and Huguenots fled to England , with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere . <\s>
<s> In relative terms , this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain . <\s>
<s> Andrew Lortie , a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London , became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of transubstantiation during Mass . <\s>
<s> Following the French Crown 's revocation of the Edict of Nantes , many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries , encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants ' settling in Ireland . <\s>
<s> Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite war in Ireland , for which they were rewarded with land grants and titles , many settling in Dublin . <\s>
<s> Significant Huguenot settlements were in Dublin , Cork , Portarlington , Lisburn , Waterford and Youghal . <\s>
<s> Smaller settlements , which included Killeshandra in County Cavan , contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry . <\s>
<s> Prince Louis de Condé , along with his sons Daniel and Osias , arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604 . <\s>
<s> The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands , regardless of their religion . <\s>
<s> The Condés established a thriving glass-making works , which provided wealth to the principality for many years . <\s>
<s> Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France . <\s>
<s> The community and its congregation remain active to this day , with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region . <\s>
<s> Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s . <\s>
<s> The bulk of Huguenot émigrés relocated to Protestant European nations such as England , Wales , Scotland , Denmark , Sweden , Switzerland , the Dutch Republic , the Electorate of Brandenburg and Electorate of the Palatinate in the Holy Roman Empire , the Duchy of Prussia , the Channel Islands , and Ireland . <\s>
<s> They also spread beyond Europe to the Dutch Cape Colony in South Africa , the Dutch East Indies , the Caribbean , and several of the English colonies of North America , and Quebec , where they were accepted and allowed to worship freely . <\s>
<s> Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins , arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France , it must have originated in the French language . <\s>
<s> The `` Hugues hypothesis '' argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet , king of France , who reigned long before the Reformation . <\s>
<s> He was regarded by the Gallicans and Protestants as a noble man who respected people 's dignity and lives . <\s>
<s> Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos , or those who want Hugo . <\s>
<s> Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and Gallican Roman Catholics , such as Jacques Lefevre . <\s>
<s> The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church , on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome , a foreign power . <\s>
<s> During the Protestant Reformation , Lefevre , a professor at the University of Paris , published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523 , followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530 . <\s>
<s> William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation , establishing a Protestant government in Geneva . <\s>
<s> Jean Cauvin , another student at the University of Paris , also converted to Protestantism . <\s>
<s> Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I , the remaining French Waldensians , then mostly in the Luberon region , sought to join William Farel , Calvin and the Reformation , and Olivetan published a French Bible for them . <\s>
<s> The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence . <\s>
<s> Sometime between 1550 and 1580 , members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots . <\s>
<s> In what became known as the St. Bartholomew 's Day Massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572 , Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris . <\s>
<s> Similar massacres took place in other towns in the weeks following . <\s>
<s> The main provincial towns and cities experiencing the Massacre were Aix , Bordeaux , Bourges , Lyons , Meaux , Orleans , Rouen , Toulouse , and Troyes . <\s>
<s> Nearly 3,000 Protestants were slaughtered in Toulouse alone . <\s>
<s> The exact number of fatalities throughout the country is not known . <\s>
<s> On 23–24 August , between about 2,000 and 3,000 Protestants were killed in Paris and between 3,000 and 7,000 more in the French provinces . <\s>
<s> By 17 September , almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone . <\s>
<s> Beyond Paris , the killings continued until 3 October . <\s>
<s> An amnesty granted in 1573 pardoned the perpetrators . <\s>
<s> Louis XIV gained the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert . <\s>
<s> At first he sent missionaries , backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Catholicism . <\s>
<s> Then he imposed penalties , closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favored professions . <\s>
<s> Escalating , he instituted dragonnades , which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops , in an effort to forcibly convert them . <\s>
<s> In 1685 , he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau , revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal . <\s>
<s> New Rochelle , located in the county of Westchester on the north shore of Long Island Sound , seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York . <\s>
<s> It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called `` Bauffet 's Point '' after traveling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution , four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes . <\s>
<s> They purchased from John Pell , Lord of Pelham Manor , a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of Jacob Leisler . <\s>
<s> It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle , their former strong-hold in France . <\s>
<s> A small wooden church was first erected in the community , followed by a second church that built of stone . <\s>

<s> The church was eventually replaced by a third , Trinity-St. Paul 's Episcopal Church , which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church `` Eglise du St. Esperit '' on Pine Street in New York City , which is preserved as a relic in the tower room . <\s>
<s> The Huguenot cemetery , or `` Huguenot Burial Ground '' , has since been recognized as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders , early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries . <\s>
<s> Most of the Huguenot congregations in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members . <\s>
<s> The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities , which led to their assimilation . <\s>
<s> Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century . <\s>
<s> Assimilated , the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life , especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods . <\s>
<s> For example , E.I. du Pont , a former student of Lavoisier , established the Eleutherian gunpowder mills . <\s>
<s> One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was Pierre Bayle . <\s>
<s> He started teaching in Rotterdam , where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece , Historical and Critical Dictionary . <\s>
<s> It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US Library of Congress . <\s>
<s> Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names , although they typically use Dutch given names . <\s>
<s> Due to the Huguenots ' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation , some of the Dutch patriciate are of part-Huguenot descent . <\s>
<s> Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions , such as the celebration and feast of their patron Saint Nicolas , similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas feast . <\s>
<s> The French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter in 1550 . <\s>
<s> It is now located at Soho Square . <\s>
<s> Huguenot refugees flocked to Shoreditch , London . <\s>
<s> They established a major weaving industry in and around Spitalfields in East London . <\s>
<s> In Wandsworth , their gardening skills benefited the Battersea market gardens . <\s>

<s> Around 1685 , Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia . <\s>
<s> Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany , 20,000 of whom were welcomed in Brandenburg-Prussia , where they were granted special privileges and churches in which to worship by Frederick William , Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia . <\s>
<s> The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army : the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 and 15 . <\s>
<s> Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of Baden , Franconia , Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel , Duchy of Württemberg , in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts , in the Palatinate and Palatinate-Zweibrücken , in the Rhine-Main-Area , in modern-day Saarland ; and 1,500 found refuge in Hamburg , Bremen and Lower Saxony . <\s>
<s> Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of George William , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Celle . <\s>
<s> Frederick William , Elector of Brandenburg , invited Huguenots to settle in his realms , and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia . <\s>
<s> Several prominent German military , cultural , and political figures were ethnic Huguenot , including poet Theodor Fontane , General Hermann von François , the hero of the First World War Battle of Tannenberg , Luftwaffe General and fighter ace Adolf Galland , Luftwaffe flying ace Hans-Joachim Marseille , and famed U-boat captain Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière . <\s>
<s> The last Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic , Lothar de Maizière , is also a descendant of a Huguenot family , as is the German Federal Minister of the Interior , Thomas de Maizière . <\s>
<s> Steam engines are external combustion engines , where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products . <\s>
<s> Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power , nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used . <\s>
<s> The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle . <\s>
<s> In the cycle , water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure . <\s>
<s> When expanded through pistons or turbines , mechanical work is done . <\s>
<s> The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler . <\s>
<s> The first commercially successful true engine , in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine , was the atmospheric engine , invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712 . <\s>
<s> It was an improvement over Savery 's steam pump , using a piston as proposed by Papin . <\s>
<s> Newcomen 's engine was relatively inefficient , and in most cases was used for pumping water . <\s>
<s> It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder . <\s>
<s> It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible , and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable `` head '' . <\s>
<s> Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel . <\s>
<s> The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and , on 21 February 1804 , the world 's first railway journey took place as Trevithick 's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks , near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales . <\s>
<s> The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency . <\s>
<s> Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives . <\s>
<s> The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water , so that they may be run continuously . <\s>
<s> Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps ; however , other types are used . <\s>
<s> Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector , which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler . <\s>
<s> Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used , except in applications such as steam locomotives . <\s>
<s> It is a logical extension of the compound engine to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency . <\s>
<s> The result is the multiple expansion engine . <\s>
<s> Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively . <\s>
<s> These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter . <\s>
<s> These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage . <\s>
<s> As with the double expansion engine , if space is at a premium , then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage . <\s>
<s> Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline , but various other formations were used . <\s>
<s> In the late 19th century , the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines . <\s>
<s> Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders , one at each end of the engine . <\s>
<s> This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced , resulting in a smoother , faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration . <\s>
<s> This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners , but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine . <\s>
<s> In the 1840s and 50s , there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate , variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve ; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff . <\s>
<s> The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events , at the expense of increased friction and wear , and the mechanism tended to be complicated . <\s>
<s> The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred . <\s>
<s> This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson , Joy and Walschaerts motions . <\s>
<s> Corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms . <\s>
<s> Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler 's firebox . <\s>
<s> If the water level drops , such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly , the lead melts and the steam escapes , warning the operators , who may then manually suppress the fire . <\s>
<s> Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire . <\s>
<s> The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly , depressurizing the boiler . <\s>
<s> If they were any larger , the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew . <\s>
<s> In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion . <\s>
<s> Watt 's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered . <\s>
<s> The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained . <\s>
<s> By 1883 , engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible . <\s>
<s> The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution , allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable . <\s>
<s> The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced , but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives . <\s>
<s> The history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century AD ; the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria . <\s>
<s> In the following centuries , the few steam-powered `` engines '' known were , like the aeolipile , essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam . <\s>
<s> A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629 . <\s>
<s> Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions , including a water pump for draining inundated mines . <\s>
<s> Denis Papin , a Huguenot refugee , did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679 , and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690 . <\s>
<s> Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use . <\s>
<s> Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures , giving improved efficiency . <\s>
<s> These stages were called expansions , with double and triple expansion engines being common , especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried . <\s>
<s> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating steam engines , with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine . <\s>
<s> The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century . <\s>
<s> Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines , have fewer moving parts , and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means . <\s>
<s> Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century , where their efficiency , higher speed appropriate to generator service , and smooth rotation were advantages . <\s>
<s> Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines . <\s>
<s> In the United States 90 % of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources . <\s>
<s> Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century . <\s>
<s> The heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources , most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space . <\s>
<s> In some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor , geothermal energy , solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process . <\s>
<s> In the case of model or toy steam engines , the heat source can be an electric heating element . <\s>
<s> The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator . <\s>
<s> Early versions were in use by 1851 , but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862 . <\s>
<s> The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle , which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower . <\s>
<s> It was routinely used by engineers , mechanics and insurance inspectors . <\s>
<s> The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines . <\s>
<s> See image of indicator diagram below . <\s>
<s> With two-cylinder compounds used in railway work , the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other . <\s>
<s> When the double expansion group is duplicated , producing a 4-cylinder compound , the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180° , the groups being set at 90° to each other . <\s>
<s> In one case , the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank , again set at 90° as for a two-cylinder engine . <\s>
<s> With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement , the LP cranks were either set at 90° with the HP one at 135° to the other two , or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120° . <\s>
<s> In most reciprocating piston engines , the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke , entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port . <\s>
<s> The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes ; the cycle also comprises four events – admission , expansion , exhaust , compression . <\s>
<s> These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder ; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end and are driven by valve gear , of which there are many types . <\s>
<s> Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where , during each stroke , the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam , whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature . <\s>
<s> The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction . <\s>
<s> By this means , the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance , and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower . <\s>
<s> However , the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties . <\s>
<s> The Quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas , while exhausting in cold areas . <\s>
<s> An oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder . <\s>
<s> Instead of valves , the entire cylinder rocks , or oscillates , such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting . <\s>
<s> These engines are mainly used in toys and models , because of their simplicity , but have also been used in full size working engines , mainly on ships where their compactness is valued . <\s>
<s> The working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system , where the working fluid is recycled continuously , or may be an `` open loop '' system , where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere , and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied . <\s>
<s> Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties , such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry , abundance , low cost , and its thermodynamic properties . <\s>
<s> Mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine . <\s>
<s> Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle . <\s>
<s> The efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid . <\s>
<s> Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid , the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small ; in steam turbines , turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C . <\s>
<s> This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63 % compared with an actual efficiency of 42 % for a modern coal-fired power station . <\s>
<s> This low turbine entry temperature is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations . <\s>
<s> Steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the Industrial Revolution and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories , mills and mines ; powering pumping stations ; and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives , ships , steamboats and road vehicles . <\s>
<s> Their use in agriculture led to an increase in the land available for cultivation . <\s>
<s> There have at one time or another been steam-powered farm tractors , motorcycles and even automobiles as the Stanley Steamer . <\s>
<s> Trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives , concluding with the Catch Me Who Can in 1808 . <\s>
<s> Only four years later , the successful twin-cylinder locomotive Salamanca by Matthew Murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway . <\s>
<s> In 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway . <\s>
<s> This was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829 , he built The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials . <\s>
<s> The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830 making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains . <\s>
<s> A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf , who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805 . <\s>
<s> In the compound engine , high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure cylinders . <\s>
<s> The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each . <\s>
<s> This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling , increasing the efficiency of the engine . <\s>
<s> By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders , torque variability can be reduced . <\s>
<s> To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the bore , and often the stroke , are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders . <\s>
<s> The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80 % regime for steam turbines . <\s>
<s> In electricity production , the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators , which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines . <\s>
<s> In marine service , , steam turbines with reduction gearing dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century , being more efficient than reciprocating steam engines . <\s>
<s> In recent decades , reciprocating Diesel engines , and gas turbines , have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications . <\s>
<s> The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine . <\s>
<s> The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production , and utilizes the phase change of water to provide a practical heat/power conversion system . <\s>
<s> The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser . <\s>
<s> The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications . <\s>
<s> In the 1990s , Rankine steam cycles generated about 90 % of all electric power used throughout the world , including virtually all solar , biomass , coal and nuclear power plants . <\s>
<s> It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine , a Scottish polymath . <\s>
<s> The historical measure of a steam engine 's energy efficiency was its `` duty '' . <\s>
<s> The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs . <\s>
<s> Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel of coal . <\s>
<s> The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million , but most were closer to 5 million . <\s>
<s> Watt 's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million , but averaged about 17 . <\s>
<s> This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design . <\s>
<s> Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million . <\s>
<s> Reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating steam engines in commercial usage , and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation . <\s>
<s> Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines , the `` steam age '' is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century . <\s>
<s> The first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump , developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery . <\s>
<s> It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below , then it used steam pressure to raise it higher . <\s>
<s> Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic . <\s>
<s> They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions . <\s>
<s> It received some use in mines , pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery . <\s>
<s> An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost . <\s>
<s> Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery 's construction `` to render it capable of working itself '' , as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751 . <\s>
<s> It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century . <\s>
<s> One engine was still known to be operating in 1820 . <\s>
<s> Around 1800 Richard Trevithick and , separately , Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure steam ; Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802 . <\s>
<s> These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications . <\s>
<s> Thereafter , technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller , faster , or more powerful , depending on the intended application . <\s>
<s> Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use , various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines . <\s>
<s> The company Energiprojekt AB in Sweden has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam . <\s>
<s> The efficiency of Energiprojekt 's steam engine reaches some 27-30 % on high-pressure engines . <\s>
<s> It is a single-step , 5-cylinder engine with superheated steam and consumes approx. 4 kg of steam per kWh . <\s>
<s> Where CHP is not used , steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink . <\s>
<s> The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans , rivers , lakes , and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal . <\s>
<s> The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump . <\s>
<s> A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly . <\s>
<s> Evaporative cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water ; this water is kept separate from the condensate , which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler . <\s>
<s> Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air . <\s>
<s> Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than `` once-through '' cooling by river or lake water ; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling , but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water . <\s>
<s> The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt 's partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building . <\s>
<s> The governor could not actually hold a set speed , because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes . <\s>
<s> The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler . <\s>
<s> Also , there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change . <\s>
<s> As a consequence , engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed , such as cotton spinning . <\s>
<s> The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off , good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century . <\s>
<s> The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units , for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880 ; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated . <\s>
<s> This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge . <\s>
<s> However , although never in the majority , it was popular in many other countries . <\s>
<s> The simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction . <\s>
<s> Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually `` shortening the cutoff '' or rather , shortening the admission event ; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period . <\s>
<s> However , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant ; if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression . <\s>
<s> Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years , but early devices were not practical . <\s>
<s> The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine in 1606 . <\s>
<s> In 1698 Thomas Savery patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped . <\s>
<s> Savery 's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber , and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water . <\s>
<s> Thomas Newcomen 's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston , and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine . <\s>
<s> A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors mounted on a drive shaft , alternating with a series of stators fixed to the turbine casing . <\s>
<s> The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge . <\s>
<s> Steam acts upon these blades , producing rotary motion . <\s>
<s> The stator consists of a similar , but fixed , series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage . <\s>
<s> A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum . <\s>
<s> The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam , giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages . <\s>
<s> Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed , therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications , such as a ship 's propeller . <\s>
<s> In the vast majority of large electric generating stations , turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing . <\s>
<s> Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute in the USA with 60 Hertz power , 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems . <\s>
<s> In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds , 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM . <\s>
<s> A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction . <\s>
<s> Therefore , a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction . <\s>
<s> The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines . <\s>
<s> For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors . <\s>
<s> However , most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant , so that indirectly the world 's industry is still dependent on steam power . <\s>
<s> Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover . <\s>
<s> This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement . <\s>
<s> It is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the Wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine . <\s>
<s> Many such engines have been designed , from the time of James Watt to the present day , but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production ; see link at bottom of article for more details . <\s>
<s> The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion ; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient . <\s>
<s> Lack of expansive working , or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs . <\s>
<s> The next major step occurred when James Watt developed an improved version of Newcomen 's engine , with a separate condenser . <\s>
<s> Boulton and Watt 's early engines used half as much coal as John Smeaton 's improved version of Newcomen 's . <\s>
<s> Newcomen 's and Watt 's early engines were `` atmospheric '' . <\s>
<s> They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam , instead of the pressure of expanding steam . <\s>
<s> The engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure . <\s>
<s> Steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high ; one may be adjusted by the user , the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe . <\s>
<s> Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler . <\s>
<s> One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure . <\s>
<s> Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers , leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine . <\s>
<s> The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve , which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken . <\s>
<s> This arrangement is considerably safer . <\s>
<s> The acme of the horizontal engine was the Corliss steam engine , patented in 1849 , which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff . <\s>
<s> When Corliss was given the Rumford medal the committee said that `` no one invention since Watt 's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine '' . <\s>
<s> In addition to using 30 % less steam , it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off , making it well suited to manufacturing , especially cotton spinning . <\s>
<s> The steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory ; however , the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam . <\s>
<s> The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser . <\s>
<s> Watt independently discovered latent heat , which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black , who also advised Watt on experimental procedures . <\s>
<s> Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure . <\s>
<s> Otherwise , the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature . <\s>
<s> The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine . <\s>
<s> One of the principal advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump , the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point . <\s>
<s> By condensing the fluid , the work required by the pump consumes only 1 % to 3 % of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle . <\s>
<s> The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature . <\s>
<s> Gas turbines , for instance , have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °C . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless , the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched . <\s>
<s> Other components are often present ; pumps to supply water to the boiler during operation , condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation , and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point , and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes . <\s>
<s> When coal is used , a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin to the firebox . <\s>
<s> Land-based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam , as feed water was usually readily available . <\s>
<s> Prior to and during World War I , the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential . <\s>
<s> It was however superseded by the British invention steam turbine where speed was required , for instance in warships , such as the dreadnought battleships , and ocean liners . <\s>
<s> HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine . <\s>
<s> Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator . <\s>
<s> Nuclear-powered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion , with generators providing auxiliary power , or else employ turbo-electric transmission , where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors . <\s>
<s> A limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured . <\s>
<s> Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in Sweden and for express passenger work in Britain , but were not repeated . <\s>
<s> Elsewhere , notably in the U.S.A. , more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally , but not reproduced . <\s>
<s> It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done . <\s>
<s> The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because , when an efficient turbine is used , the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle . <\s>
<s> The main difference is that heat addition and rejection are isobaric processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle . <\s>
<s> In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas . <\s>
<s> Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor . <\s>
<s> The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8 . <\s>
<s> It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds with most elements . <\s>
<s> By mass , oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . <\s>
<s> At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2 . <\s>
<s> Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8 % of the Earth 's atmosphere . <\s>
<s> However , monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend , because of fossil-fuel burning . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth 's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide , making up almost half of the crust 's mass . <\s>
<s> Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , contain oxygen , as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells , teeth , and bone . <\s>
<s> Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water . <\s>
<s> It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . <\s>
<s> Another form of oxygen , ozone , strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation , but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog . <\s>
<s> At even higher low earth orbit altitudes , sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft . <\s>
<s> In the late 17th century , Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion . <\s>
<s> English chemist John Mayow refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus . <\s>
<s> In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air 's volume before extinguishing the subjects . <\s>
<s> From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion . <\s>
<s> In the meantime , on August 1 , 1774 , an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide inside a glass tube , which liberated a gas he named `` dephlogisticated air '' . <\s>
<s> He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it . <\s>
<s> After breathing the gas himself , he wrote : `` The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards . '' <\s>
<s> Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled `` An Account of Further Discoveries in Air '' which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air . <\s>
<s> Because he published his findings first , Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery . <\s>
<s> One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics , Philo of Byzantium . <\s>
<s> In his work Pneumatica , Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel 's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck . <\s>
<s> Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass . <\s>
<s> Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo 's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration . <\s>
<s> Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion . <\s>
<s> Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity ; an ignition event , such as heat or a spark , is needed to trigger combustion . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is the oxidant , not the fuel , but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion . <\s>
<s> Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential , such as peroxides , chlorates , nitrates , perchlorates , and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire . <\s>
<s> Concentrated O2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically . <\s>
<s> Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel ; and therefore the design and manufacture of O2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized . <\s>
<s> The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure , instead of the 1⁄3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide . <\s>
<s> The Earth 's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon , aluminium , iron , and calcium carbonate . <\s>
<s> The rest of the Earth 's crust is also made of oxygen compounds , in particular various complex silicates . <\s>
<s> The Earth 's mantle , of much larger mass than the crust , is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron . <\s>
<s> John Dalton 's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another . <\s>
<s> For example , Dalton assumed that water 's formula was HO , giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen , instead of the modern value of about 16 . <\s>
<s> In 1805 , Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen ; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water 's composition , based on what is now called Avogadro 's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules . <\s>
<s> Highly combustible materials that leave little residue , such as wood or coal , were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston ; whereas non-combustible substances that corrode , such as iron , contained very little . <\s>
<s> Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory , nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea ; instead , it was based on observations of what happens when something burns , that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process . <\s>
<s> The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products . <\s>
<s> Indeed , one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals , too , gain weight in rusting . <\s>
<s> In this dioxygen , the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other . <\s>
<s> The bond can be variously described based on level of theory , but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms , the filling of which results in a bond order of two . <\s>
<s> More specifically , the double bond is the result of sequential , low-to-high energy , or Aufbau , filling of orbitals , and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons , after sequential filling of the low σ and σ * orbitals ; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and π overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis , and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest π and π * orbitals . <\s>
<s> Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele , in Uppsala , in 1773 or earlier , and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire , in 1774 , but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first . <\s>
<s> The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier , whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion . <\s>
<s> Its name derives from the Greek roots ὀξύς oxys , `` acid '' , literally `` sharp '' , referring to the sour taste of acids and -γενής -genes , `` producer '' , literally `` begetter '' , because at the time of naming , it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition . <\s>
<s> Common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel , plastics and textiles , brazing , welding and cutting of steels and other metals , rocket propellant , in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft , submarines , spaceflight and diving . <\s>
<s> This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen 's double bond character and reactivity , and a triplet electronic ground state . <\s>
<s> An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen , orbitals that are of equal energy — i.e. , degenerate — is a configuration termed a spin triplet state . <\s>
<s> Hence , the ground state of the O2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen . <\s>
<s> The highest energy , partially filled orbitals are antibonding , and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two . <\s>
<s> Because of its unpaired electrons , triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules , which have paired electron spins ; this prevents spontaneous combustion . <\s>
<s> In one experiment , Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container . <\s>
<s> He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container , which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed . <\s>
<s> He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in . <\s>
<s> This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général , which was published in 1777 . <\s>
<s> In that work , he proved that air is a mixture of two gases ; ' vital air ' , which is essential to combustion and respiration , and azote , which did not support either . <\s>
<s> Azote later became nitrogen in English , although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages . <\s>
<s> Trioxygen is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue . <\s>
<s> Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O2 by ultraviolet radiation . <\s>
<s> Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum , the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet . <\s>
<s> Near the Earth 's surface , it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust . <\s>
<s> The metastable molecule tetraoxygen was discovered in 2001 , and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen . <\s>
<s> It was proven in 2006 that this phase , created by pressurizing O2 to 20 GPa , is in fact a rhombohedral O8 cluster . <\s>
<s> This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O2 or O3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel . <\s>
<s> A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures , this phase becomes superconducting . <\s>
<s> The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen , O2 . <\s>
<s> It is the form that is a major part of the Earth 's atmosphere . <\s>
<s> O2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ·mol−1 , which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of O2 with any organic molecule . <\s>
<s> Due to its energy content , O2 is used by complex forms of life , such as animals , in cellular respiration . <\s>
<s> Other aspects of O2 are covered in the remainder of this article . <\s>
<s> In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study . <\s>
<s> The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson . <\s>
<s> Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them . <\s>
<s> Later , in 1901 , oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed O2 . <\s>
<s> This method of welding and cutting metal later became common . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen is . <\s>
<s> Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O2 for every 2 molecules of N2 , compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1 : 4 . <\s>
<s> The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent , and about twice as much dissolves at 0 °C than at 20 °C . <\s>
<s> At 25 °C and 1 standard atmosphere of air , freshwater contains about 6.04 milliliters of oxygen per liter , whereas seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter . <\s>
<s> At 5 °C the solubility increases to 9.0 mL per liter for water and 7.2 mL per liter for sea water . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth 's biosphere , air , sea and land . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . <\s>
<s> About 0.9 % of the Sun 's mass is oxygen . <\s>
<s> Oxygen constitutes 49.2 % of the Earth 's crust by mass and is the major component of the world 's oceans . <\s>
<s> Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth 's atmosphere , taking up 20.8 % of its volume and 23.1 % of its mass . <\s>
<s> Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere : Mars and Venus have far lower concentrations . <\s>
<s> The O2 surrounding these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation impacting oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide . <\s>
<s> By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied , and its components isolated , by compressing and cooling it . <\s>
<s> Using a cascade method , Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide , which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it . <\s>
<s> He sent a telegram on December 22 , 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen . <\s>
<s> Just two days later , French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen . <\s>
<s> Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analysis could be conducted . <\s>
<s> Oxygen was liquified in stable state for the first time on March 29 , 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University , Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski . <\s>
<s> Planetary geologists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in samples from the Earth , the Moon , Mars , and meteorites , but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun , believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula . <\s>
<s> Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth . <\s>
<s> The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun 's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth . <\s>
<s> Singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular O2 in which all the electron spins are paired . <\s>
<s> It is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se . <\s>
<s> In nature , singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis , using the energy of sunlight . <\s>
<s> It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength , and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen . <\s>
<s> Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues . <\s>
<s> Paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago . <\s>
<s> Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope , oxygen-16 , evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 % heavier oxygen-18 ; this disparity increases at lower temperatures . <\s>
<s> During periods of lower global temperatures , snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16 , and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18 . <\s>
<s> Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate . <\s>
<s> Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples that are up to several hundreds of thousands of years old . <\s>
<s> Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm . <\s>
<s> Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform . <\s>
<s> This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation 's reflectance from its fluorescence , which is much weaker . <\s>
<s> The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation ; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale . <\s>
<s> In the triplet form , O2 molecules are paramagnetic . <\s>
<s> That is , they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field , because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule , and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O2 molecules . <\s>
<s> Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that , in laboratory demonstrations , a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet . <\s>
<s> Reactive oxygen species , such as superoxide ion and hydrogen peroxide , are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms . <\s>
<s> Parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide , superoxide , and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes . <\s>
<s> Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms , which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event , about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms . <\s>
<s> Oxygen condenses at 90.20 K , and freezes at 54.36 K . <\s>
<s> Both liquid and solid O2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red . <\s>
<s> High-purity liquid O2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air . <\s>
<s> Liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air , using liquid nitrogen as a coolant . <\s>
<s> It is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials . <\s>
<s> Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world 's water bodies . <\s>
<s> The increased solubility of O2 at lower temperatures has important implications for ocean life , as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content . <\s>
<s> Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of O2 in eutrophic water bodies . <\s>
<s> Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water 's biochemical oxygen demand , or the amount of O2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration . <\s>
<s> Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth 's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved , probably about 3.5 billion years ago . <\s>
<s> Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon . <\s>
<s> For the first billion years , any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations . <\s>
<s> When such oxygen sinks became saturated , free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7 billion years ago , reaching 10 % of its present level around 1.7 billion years ago . <\s>
<s> The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle . <\s>
<s> This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth : the atmosphere , the biosphere , and the lithosphere . <\s>
<s> The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis , which is responsible for modern Earth 's atmosphere . <\s>
<s> Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere , while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere . <\s>
<s> In the present equilibrium , production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year . <\s>
<s> The other major method of producing O2 gas involves passing a stream of clean , dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves , which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 % to 93 % O2 . <\s>
<s> Simultaneously , nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed , by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it , in the reverse direction of flow . <\s>
<s> After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged , thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline . <\s>
<s> This is known as pressure swing adsorption . <\s>
<s> Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies . <\s>
<s> Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen . <\s>
<s> DC electricity must be used : if AC is used , the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2 : 1 . <\s>
<s> Contrary to popular belief , the 2 : 1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves . <\s>
<s> A similar method is the electrocatalytic O2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids . <\s>
<s> Chemical catalysts can be used as well , such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines , and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies . <\s>
<s> Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current , to produce nearly pure O2 gas . <\s>
<s> Oxygen , as a supposed mild euphoric , has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports . <\s>
<s> Oxygen bars are establishments , found in Japan , California , and Las Vegas , Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O2 exposure for a fee . <\s>
<s> Professional athletes , especially in American football , also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a `` boost '' in performance . <\s>
<s> The pharmacological effect is doubtful ; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation . <\s>
<s> Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise . <\s>
<s> Hyperbaric medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O2 around the patient and , when needed , the medical staff . <\s>
<s> Carbon monoxide poisoning , gas gangrene , and decompression sickness are sometimes treated using these devices . <\s>
<s> Increased O2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin . <\s>
<s> Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene , so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them . <\s>
<s> Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive , resulting in bubbles of inert gas , mostly nitrogen and helium , forming in their blood . <\s>
<s> Increasing the pressure of O2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment . <\s>
<s> Uptake of O2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration , so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine . <\s>
<s> Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient 's blood , but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs , easing work load on the heart . <\s>
<s> Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema , pneumonia , some heart disorders , some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure , and any disease that impairs the body 's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen . <\s>
<s> Due to its electronegativity , oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides . <\s>
<s> The surface of most metals , such as aluminium and titanium , are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion . <\s>
<s> Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds , with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show . <\s>
<s> For example , the mineral FeO is written as Fe1 − xO , where x is usually around 0.05 . <\s>
<s> People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental O2 supplies . <\s>
<s> Passengers traveling in commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of O2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization . <\s>
<s> Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat , causing oxygen masks to drop . <\s>
<s> Pulling on the masks `` to start the flow of oxygen '' as cabin safety instructions dictate , forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister . <\s>
<s> A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction . <\s>
<s> Oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks , cryogenics and chemical compounds . <\s>
<s> For reasons of economy , oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers , since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C . <\s>
<s> Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers , which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas . <\s>
<s> Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers , which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building . <\s>
<s> Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas ; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting . <\s>
<s> Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are : alcohols ; ethers ; ketones ; aldehydes ; carboxylic acids ; esters ; acid anhydrides ; and amides . <\s>
<s> There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen , including : acetone , methanol , ethanol , isopropanol , furan , THF , diethyl ether , dioxane , ethyl acetate , DMF , DMSO , acetic acid , and formic acid . <\s>
<s> Acetone and phenol are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances . <\s>
<s> Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are : glycerol , formaldehyde , glutaraldehyde , citric acid , acetic anhydride , and acetamide . <\s>
<s> Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms . <\s>
<s> The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to life . <\s>
<s> Only a few common complex biomolecules , such as squalene and the carotenes , contain no oxygen . <\s>
<s> Of the organic compounds with biological relevance , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen . <\s>
<s> All fats , fatty acids , amino acids , and proteins contain oxygen . <\s>
<s> Oxygen also occurs in phosphate groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP , in the backbone and the purines and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA , and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite . <\s>
<s> Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving . <\s>
<s> Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis . <\s>
<s> Exposure to a O2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa may lead to convulsions . <\s>
<s> Acute oxygen toxicity can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 % O2 at 66 m or more of depth ; the same thing can occur by breathing 100 % O2 at only 6 m . <\s>
<s> Breathing pure O2 in space applications , such as in some modern space suits , or in early spacecraft such as Apollo , causes no damage due to the low total pressures used . <\s>
<s> In the case of spacesuits , the O2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is , in general , about 30 kPa , and the resulting O2 partial pressure in the astronaut 's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level O2 partial pressure . <\s>
<s> Oxygen gas can be toxic at elevated partial pressures , leading to convulsions and other health problems . <\s>
<s> Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals , equal to about 50 % oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level O2 partial pressure of about 21 kPa . <\s>
<s> This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators , since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30 % – 50 % O2 by volume . <\s>
<s> Although this figure also is subject to wide variation , depending on type of mask . <\s>
<s> The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries proclaimed an oil embargo . <\s>
<s> By the end of the embargo in March 1974 , the price of oil had risen from US $ 3 per barrel to nearly $ 12 globally ; US prices were significantly higher . <\s>
<s> The embargo caused an oil crisis , or `` shock '' , with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy . <\s>
<s> It was later called the `` first oil shock '' , followed by the 1979 oil crisis , termed the `` second oil shock . '' <\s>
<s> The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO . <\s>
<s> Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott . <\s>
<s> Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents . <\s>
<s> To address this , the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants . <\s>
<s> They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights . <\s>
<s> By January 18 , 1974 , US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula . <\s>
<s> The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974 . <\s>
<s> On August 15 , 1971 , the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord . <\s>
<s> The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar , whose value was left to `` float '' . <\s>
<s> Shortly thereafter , Britain followed , floating the pound sterling . <\s>
<s> The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies . <\s>
<s> Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time , the industrialized nations increased their reserves in amounts far greater than before . <\s>
<s> The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations ' currencies . <\s>
<s> Because oil was priced in dollars , oil producers ' real income decreased . <\s>
<s> In September 1971 , OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold . <\s>
<s> This contributed to the `` Oil Shock '' . <\s>
<s> After 1971 , OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation . <\s>
<s> From 1947 to 1967 , the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year . <\s>
<s> Until the oil shock , the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities . <\s>
<s> OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions , so their real incomes lagged . <\s>
<s> The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold . <\s>
<s> On October 6 , 1973 , Syria and Egypt , with support from other Arab nations , launched a surprise attack on Israel , on Yom Kippur . <\s>
<s> This renewal of hostilities in the Arab–Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices . <\s>
<s> At the time , Iran was the world 's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally . <\s>
<s> Weeks later , the Shah of Iran said in an interview : Of course the price of oil is going to rise . <\s>
<s> Western nations increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent , and the same for sugar and cement . <\s>
<s> You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us , refined as petrochemicals , at a hundred times the price you ' ve paid us . <\s>
<s> It 's only fair that , from now on , you should pay more for oil . <\s>
<s> Let 's say ten times more . <\s>
<s> In response to American aid to Israel , on October 16 , 1973 , OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70 % , to $ 5.11 a barrel . <\s>
<s> The following day , oil ministers agreed to the embargo , a cut in production by five percent from September 's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met . <\s>
<s> On October 19 , Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $ 2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel , including $ 1.5 billion in outright grants . <\s>
<s> George Lenczowski notes , Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon 's eagerness to prevent Israel 's collapse . <\s>
<s> This decision triggered a collective OPEC response . <\s>
<s> Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States . <\s>
<s> Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20 , 1973 . <\s>
<s> At their Kuwait meeting , OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a `` principal hostile country '' . <\s>
<s> Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities , amid shrinking Western demand . <\s>
<s> Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions , particularly in the Middle East . <\s>
<s> Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam , known as Wahhabism , throughout the world , via religious charities such al-Haramain Foundation , which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban . <\s>
<s> In the United States , scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973 . <\s>
<s> The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil . <\s>
<s> Further , interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger 's dominance . <\s>
<s> In the US production , distribution and price disruptions `` have been held responsible for recessions , periods of excessive inflation , reduced productivity , and lower economic growth . '' <\s>
<s> The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security . <\s>
<s> On an international level , the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries , such as automobiles . <\s>
<s> Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts . <\s>
<s> The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic . <\s>
<s> Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production . <\s>
<s> The embargo was not uniform across Europe . <\s>
<s> Of the nine members of the European Economic Community , the Netherlands faced a complete embargo , the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies , while the other six faced partial cutbacks . <\s>
<s> The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel , and Harold Wilson 's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War . <\s>
<s> His successor , Ted Heath , reversed this policy in 1970 , calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders . <\s>
<s> Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo , the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own - a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the change of government . <\s>
<s> Heath asked the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter . <\s>
<s> The UK , Germany , Italy , Switzerland and Norway banned flying , driving and boating on Sundays . <\s>
<s> Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil . <\s>
<s> The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity . <\s>
<s> Price controls exacerbated the crisis in the US . <\s>
<s> The system limited the price of `` old oil '' while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment . <\s>
<s> Predictably , old oil was withdrawn from the market , creating greater scarcity . <\s>
<s> The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies . <\s>
<s> The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration . <\s>
<s> Scarcity was addressed by rationing . <\s>
<s> Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973 . <\s>
<s> In 1973 , Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office , a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo . <\s>
<s> Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972 , which worked for states whose populations were not increasing . <\s>
<s> In other states , lines at gasoline stations were common . <\s>
<s> The American Automobile Association reported that in the last week of February 1974 , 20 % of American gasoline stations had no fuel . <\s>
<s> To help reduce consumption , in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act . <\s>
<s> Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began in 1975 , and in 1977 the cabinet-level Department of Energy was created , followed by the National Energy Act of 1978 . <\s>
<s> The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy , nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels . <\s>
<s> There is criticism that American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking , promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities . <\s>
<s> Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation , congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient , but whose prospects are doubtful . <\s>
<s> In 2004 , declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973 . <\s>
<s> Although no explicit plan was mentioned , a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that `` it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force . '' <\s>
<s> British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions , which concluded America `` might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries , '' and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon . <\s>
<s> Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force , intelligence warned `` the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources , and would result in the ' total alienation ' of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World . '' <\s>
<s> Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East , Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71 % of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970 . <\s>
<s> On November 7 , 1973 , the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a `` nonfriendly '' country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy . <\s>
<s> It received a 5 % production cut in December , causing a panic . <\s>
<s> On November 22 , Japan issued a statement `` asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories , advocating Palestinian self-determination , and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions '' . <\s>
<s> By December 25 , Japan was considered an Arab-friendly state . <\s>
<s> The USSR 's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region , also marked by increased American weapons sales , technology , and outright military presence . <\s>
<s> Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues . <\s>
<s> Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries . <\s>
<s> By 1979 , Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel 's . <\s>
<s> Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran , a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation , which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution . <\s>
<s> Saudi Arabia , on the other hand , is an Arab , largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy . <\s>
<s> In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism , a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year . <\s>
<s> In November 2010 , Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program , describing Iran as `` a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination . '' <\s>
<s> The crisis reduced the demand for large cars . <\s>
<s> Japanese imports , primarily the Toyota Corona , the Toyota Corolla , the Datsun B210 , the Datsun 510 , the Honda Civic , the Mitsubishi Galant , the Subaru DL , and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines . <\s>
<s> Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive , which became de facto standards . <\s>
<s> Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts , and both Toyota and Nissan introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II , the Toyota Cressida , the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810 , which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning , power steering , AM-FM radios , and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle . <\s>
<s> A decade after the 1973 oil crisis , Honda , Toyota and Nissan , affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints , opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands . <\s>
<s> Compact trucks were introduced , such as the Toyota Hilux and the Datsun Truck , followed by the Mazda Truck , and the Isuzu-built Chevrolet LUV . <\s>
<s> Mitsubishi rebranded its Forte as the Dodge D-50 a few years after the oil crisis . <\s>
<s> Mazda , Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford , Chrysler , and GM , respectively . <\s>
<s> Later the American makers introduced their domestic replacements , ending their captive import policy . <\s>
<s> An increase in imported cars into North America forced General Motors , Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales . <\s>
<s> The Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon from Chrysler , the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s . <\s>
<s> By 1985 , the average American vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon , compared to 13.5 in 1970 . <\s>
<s> The improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $ 12 from 1974 to 1979 . <\s>
<s> Sales of large sedans for most makes recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis . <\s>
<s> The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood , Buick Electra , Oldsmobile 98 , Lincoln Continental , Mercury Marquis , and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s . <\s>
<s> The only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air , and Ford Galaxie 500 . <\s>
<s> Slightly smaller , mid-size models such as the Oldsmobile Cutlass , Chevrolet Monte Carlo , Ford Thunderbird and various other models sold well . <\s>
<s> Federal safety standards , such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 , and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT `` downsize '' revision of vehicle categories . <\s>
<s> By 1977 , GM 's full-sized cars reflected the crisis . <\s>
<s> By 1979 , virtually all `` full-size '' American cars had shrunk , featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions . <\s>
<s> Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year , moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 . <\s>
<s> OPEC soon lost its preeminent position , and in 1981 , its production was surpassed by that of other countries . <\s>
<s> Additionally , its own member nations were divided . <\s>
<s> Saudi Arabia , trying to recover market share , increased production , pushing prices down , shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers . <\s>
<s> The world price , which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $ 40 per barrel , decreased during the 1980s to less than $ 10 per barrel . <\s>
<s> Adjusted for inflation , oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels . <\s>
<s> This `` sale '' price was a windfall for oil-importing nations , both developing and developed . <\s>
<s> European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation , such as Regulations and Directives , which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states . <\s>
<s> The three sources of European Union law are primary law , secondary law and supplementary law . <\s>
<s> The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union . <\s>
<s> Secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties . <\s>
<s> The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union , which under the Treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties . <\s>
<s> European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union . <\s>
<s> Where the laws of member states provide for lesser rights European Union law can be enforced by the courts of member states . <\s>
<s> In case of European Union law which should have been transposed into the laws of member states , such as Directives , the European Commission can take proceedings against the member state under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . <\s>
<s> The European Court of Justice is the highest court able to interpret European Union law . <\s>
<s> Supplementary sources of European Union law include case law by the Court of Justice , international law and general principles of European Union law . <\s>
<s> Although the European Union does not have a codified constitution , like every political body it has laws which `` constitute '' its basic governance structure . <\s>
<s> The EU 's primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states . <\s>
<s> The Treaties establish the EU 's institutions , list their powers and responsibilities , and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations . <\s>
<s> The European Commission has the initiative to propose legislation . <\s>
<s> During the ordinary legislative procedure , the Council and the European Parliament can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass . <\s>
<s> The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law . <\s>
<s> The `` European Council '' is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states . <\s>
<s> It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank . <\s>
<s> The European Court of Justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law , and develops it through precedent . <\s>
<s> The Court can review the legality of the EU institutions ' actions , in compliance with the Treaties . <\s>
<s> It can also decide upon claims for breach of EU laws from member states and citizens . <\s>
<s> The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties , the `` core '' treaties being the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . <\s>
<s> The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions , which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states . <\s>
<s> The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states , as well as certain islands and overseas territories , including Madeira , the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments . <\s>
<s> European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations , for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands . <\s>
<s> The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions , as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon . <\s>
<s> The TEU specifically excludes certain regions , for example the Faroe Islands , from the jurisdiction of European Union law . <\s>
<s> Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force , unless stated otherwise , and are generally concluded for an unlimited period . <\s>
<s> The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply . <\s>
<s> All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation , as stated in the TEU , whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties , but it can not rule on their validity , which is subject to international law . <\s>
<s> Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear , precise and unconditional . <\s>
<s> The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel , and then atomic energy , but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 . <\s>
<s> Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s . <\s>
<s> Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single , internal market in the Single European Act 1986 , to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997 , and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 . <\s>
<s> Since its establishment , more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties , from the UK , Ireland , Denmark and Norway in 1972 , Greece in 1979 , Spain and Portugal 1985 , Austria , Finland , Norway and Sweden in 1994 , the Czech Republic , Cyprus , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004 , Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2013 . <\s>
<s> Greenland signed a Treaty in 1985 giving it a special status . <\s>
<s> Following the Nice Treaty , there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent ; this would have also produced a single constitutional document . <\s>
<s> However , as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands , the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force . <\s>
<s> Instead , the Lisbon Treaty was enacted . <\s>
<s> Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty , but it was formally an amending treaty , and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them . <\s>
<s> The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union . <\s>
<s> Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should `` promote the general interest of the Union '' while Article 17 adds that Commissioners should be `` completely independent '' and not `` take instructions from any Government '' . <\s>
<s> Under article 17 , `` Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal , except where the Treaties provide otherwise . '' <\s>
<s> This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure , although the Council is the `` de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives '' . <\s>
<s> The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion , giving reasons . <\s>
<s> The Commission 's President sets the agenda for the EU 's work . <\s>
<s> Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote , usually through a `` written procedure '' of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections . <\s>
<s> Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 , there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states , including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy . <\s>
<s> The Commissioners are bargained over intensively by the member states . <\s>
<s> The Commissioners , as a block , are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve , and majority approval of the Parliament . <\s>
<s> The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament , was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon . <\s>
<s> This means Commissioners are , through the appointment process , the unelected subordinates of member state governments . <\s>
<s> Commissioners have various privileges , such as being exempt from member state taxes , and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts . <\s>
<s> Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations . <\s>
<s> This resulted in one main case , Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law . <\s>
<s> By contrast to the ECJ 's relaxed approach , a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had even the slightest sense of responsibility . <\s>
<s> This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office . <\s>
<s> In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health , John Dalli , who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive . <\s>
<s> Beyond the Commission , the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro . <\s>
<s> It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council , on the Council 's recommendation . <\s>
<s> The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings , but do not have voting rights . <\s>
<s> The second main legislative body is the Council , which is composed of different ministers of the member states . <\s>
<s> The heads of government of member states also convene a `` European Council '' that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the ' necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities ' . <\s>
<s> It meets each six months and its President is meant to ' drive forward its work ' , but it does not itself ' legislative functions ' . <\s>
<s> The Council does this : in effect this is the governments of the member states , but there will be a different minister at each meeting , depending on the topic discussed . <\s>
<s> The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions . <\s>
<s> When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size , so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states . <\s>
<s> In total there are 352 votes , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , if not consensus . <\s>
<s> TEU article 16 and TFEU article 238 define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU : currently this means around 74 per cent , or 260 of the 352 votes . <\s>
<s> This is critical during the legislative process . <\s>
<s> To make new legislation , TFEU article 294 defines the `` ordinary legislative procedure '' that applies for most EU acts . <\s>
<s> The essence is there are three readings , starting with a Commission proposal , where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs to block or suggest changes , and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block Commission amendment . <\s>
<s> Where the different institutions can not agree at any stage , a `` Conciliation Committee '' is convened , representing MEPs , ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text : if this works , it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority . <\s>
<s> This means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament , a minority in the Council , and a majority in the Commission : it is harder to change EU law than stay the same . <\s>
<s> A different procedure exists for budgets . <\s>
<s> For `` enhanced cooperation '' among a sub-set of at least member states , authorisation must be given by the Council . <\s>
<s> Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure . <\s>
<s> The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties . <\s>
<s> TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question : who ultimately has the `` competence '' to define the EU 's `` competence '' . <\s>
<s> Many member state courts believe they decide , other member state Parliaments believe they decide , while within the EU , the Court of Justice believes it has the final say . <\s>
<s> The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration . <\s>
<s> Today the Court of Justice of the European Union is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher European Court of Justice that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance . <\s>
<s> There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues , and then a separate Court of Auditors . <\s>
<s> Under the Treaty on European Union article 19 there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to `` possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices '' . <\s>
<s> A president is elected by the judges for three years . <\s>
<s> Under TEU article 19 is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law . <\s>
<s> In fact , most EU law is applied by member state courts but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling . <\s>
<s> The CJEU 's duty is to `` ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed '' , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate . <\s>
<s> Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments , including Van Gend en Loos , Mangold v Helm , and Kadi v Commission . <\s>
<s> Since its founding , the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems . <\s>
<s> This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems . <\s>
<s> Within the EU itself , the Court of Justice 's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law , then EU law has primacy . <\s>
<s> In the first major case in 1964 , Costa v ENEL , a Milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations . <\s>
<s> He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome , and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267 . <\s>
<s> The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , Costa had no claim . <\s>
<s> By contrast , the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim , not Mr Costa . <\s>
<s> However , in principle , Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice , repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos , said member states `` albeit within limited spheres , have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves '' on the `` basis of reciprocity '' . <\s>
<s> EU law would not `` be overridden by domestic legal provisions , however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question . '' <\s>
<s> This meant any `` subsequent unilateral act '' of the member state inapplicable . <\s>
<s> Similarly , in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA , a company , Simmenthal SpA , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968 . <\s>
<s> In `` accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law , '' said the Court of Justice , the `` directly applicable measures of the institutions '' `` render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law '' . <\s>
<s> This was necessary to prevent a `` corresponding denial '' of Treaty `` obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states '' , that could `` imperil the very foundations of the '' EU . <\s>
<s> But despite the views of the Court of Justice , the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis . <\s>
<s> Generally speaking , while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties , they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights . <\s>
<s> In the United Kingdom , the basic principle is that Parliament , as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy , can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law . <\s>
<s> This , however , would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU . <\s>
<s> It was held in R v Secretary of State for Transport that `` whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary '' and so `` it has always been clear '' that UK courts have a duty `` to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law . '' <\s>
<s> More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R v Secretary of State for Transport , although the UK constitution is uncodified , there could be `` fundamental principles '' of common law , and Parliament `` did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation '' of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 . <\s>
<s> The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles then it can not override German law . <\s>
<s> However , as the nicknames of the judgments go , `` so long as '' the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions , and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights , it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles . <\s>
<s> Most other member states have expressed similar reservations . <\s>
<s> This suggests the EU 's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states , its factual commitment to human rights , and the democratic will of the people . <\s>
<s> While constitutional law concerns the European Union 's governance structure , administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law . <\s>
<s> Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or `` standing '' to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties . <\s>
<s> From the EU 's foundation , the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations , if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations . <\s>
<s> However , under Directives , citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties . <\s>
<s> This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted , even though the member state government could be sued , if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation . <\s>
<s> These rules on `` direct effect '' limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law . <\s>
<s> All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review , and judged by standards of proportionality , particularly where general principles of law , or fundamental rights are engaged . <\s>
<s> The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages , but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction , in order to ensure the law is effective as possible . <\s>
<s> Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy , not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims : that is , not all EU laws have `` direct effect '' . <\s>
<s> In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties are directly effective , if they are clear and unambiguous unconditional , and did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them . <\s>
<s> Van Gend en Loos , a postal company , claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs , when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands . <\s>
<s> After a Dutch court made a reference , the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not `` expressly '' confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims , they could do so . <\s>
<s> Historically , international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement , but the Court of Justice proclaimed `` the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law '' . <\s>
<s> Because article 30 clearly , unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade , without a good justification , Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff . <\s>
<s> EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense , because as TFEU article 288 states , they are ' directly applicable in all Member States ' . <\s>
<s> Moreover , member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law , in order to prevent confusion . <\s>
<s> For instance , in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties , both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows , and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions . <\s>
<s> `` Regulations , '' held the Court of Justice , `` come into force solely by virtue of their publication '' and implementation could have the effect of `` jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union . '' <\s>
<s> On the other hand , some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures , in which case those specific rules should be followed . <\s>
<s> While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect , Directives do not generally give citizens standing to sue other citizens . <\s>
<s> In theory , this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually `` leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods '' to implement . <\s>
<s> In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards , leaving member states to apply higher standards . <\s>
<s> For example , the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law . <\s>
<s> However , on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice , citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives , but not from Directives themselves . <\s>
<s> Directives do not have so called `` horizontal '' direct effect . <\s>
<s> This view was instantly controversial , and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice refused , but there are five large exceptions . <\s>
<s> First , if a Directive 's deadline for implementation is not met , the member state can not enforce conflicting laws , and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action . <\s>
<s> So , in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline , it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti 's solvent and varnish business . <\s>
<s> A member state could `` not rely , as against individuals , on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails . '' <\s>
<s> Second , a citizen or company can invoke a Directive , not just in a dispute with a public authority , but in a dispute with another citizen or company . <\s>
<s> So , in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems , on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required . <\s>
<s> Third , if a Directive gives expression to a `` general principle '' of EU law , it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation . <\s>
<s> This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal . <\s>
<s> Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years , from age 18 to 28 , for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal . <\s>
<s> She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law . <\s>
<s> Third , if the defendant is an emanation of the state , even if not central government , it can still be bound by Directives . <\s>
<s> In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer , British Gas plc , which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65 , if pursuant to a state measure , it provided a public service , and had special powers . <\s>
<s> This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised , as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision . <\s>
<s> Fourth , national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law `` as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive '' . <\s>
<s> Textbooks often called this `` indirect effect '' . <\s>
<s> In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA the Court of Justice held that a Spanish Court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions , on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors , to conform with the First Company Law Directive article 11 , that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation can not contradict plain words in a national statute . <\s>
<s> But , fifth , if a member state has failed to implement a Directive , a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non-state parties , but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law . <\s>
<s> So , in Francovich v Italy , the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent , as the Insolvency Protection Directive required . <\s>
<s> Francovich , the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm , was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals , and there is a causal link between a member state 's violation of EU and a claimant 's loss , damages must be paid . <\s>
<s> The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence . <\s>
<s> The principles of European Union law are rules of law which have been developed by the European Court of Justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how European Union law is interpreted and applies . <\s>
<s> In formulating these principles , the courts have drawn on a variety of sources , including : public international law and legal doctrines and principles present in the legal systems of European Union member states and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights . <\s>
<s> Accepted general principles of European Union Law include fundamental rights , proportionality , legal certainty , equality before the law and subsidiarity . <\s>
<s> Proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s . <\s>
<s> According to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued . <\s>
<s> When there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted , and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued . <\s>
<s> The principle of proportionality is also recognised in Article 5 of the EC Treaty , stating that `` any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty '' . <\s>
<s> The concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s . <\s>
<s> It is an important general principle of international law and public law , which predates European Union law . <\s>
<s> As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain , in that it is clear and precise , and its legal implications foreseeable , specially when applied to financial obligations . <\s>
<s> The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis . <\s>
<s> Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law . <\s>
<s> In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws , i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published . <\s>
<s> The doctrine of legitimate expectation , which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith , is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law . <\s>
<s> The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that `` those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations '' . <\s>
<s> Fundamental rights , as in human rights , were first recognised by the European Court of Justice in the late 60s and fundamental rights are now regarded as integral part of the general principles of European Union law . <\s>
<s> As such the European Court of Justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the European Court of Justice can not uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states . <\s>
<s> The European Court of Justice also found that `` international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the member states have collaborated or of which they are signatories , can supply guidelines which should be followed within the framework of Community law . '' <\s>
<s> None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights . <\s>
<s> It was not envisaged for European Union measures , that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions , to be subject to human rights . <\s>
<s> At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights , hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights . <\s>
<s> The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states ' constitution became ever more apparent . <\s>
<s> In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights , which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions . <\s>
<s> The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of fundamental rights from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties . <\s>
<s> The 2007 Lisbon Treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in Article 6 that `` The Union recognises the rights , freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000 , as adopted at Strasbourg on 12 December 2007 , which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties . '' <\s>
<s> Therefore , the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become an integral part of European Union law , codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of European Union law . <\s>
<s> In effect , after the Lisbon Treaty , the Charter and the Convention now co-exist under European Union law , though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice in relation to European Union measures , and the latter by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to measures by member states . <\s>
<s> The Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam covering social policy issues in European Union law . <\s>
<s> The basis for the Social Chapter was developed in 1989 by the `` social partners '' representatives , namely UNICE , the employers ' confederation , the European Trade Union Confederation and CEEP , the European Centre of Public Enterprises . <\s>
<s> A toned down version was adopted as the Social Charter at the 1989 Strasbourg European Council . <\s>
<s> The Social Charter declares 30 general principles , including on fair remuneration of employment , health and safety at work , rights of disabled and elderly , the rights of workers , on vocational training and improvements of living conditions . <\s>
<s> The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation . <\s>
<s> The Social Charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states . <\s>
<s> The UK refused to sign the Social Charter and was exempt from the legislation covering Social Charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation . <\s>
<s> The UK subsequently was the only member state to veto the Social Charter being included as the `` Social Chapter '' of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty - instead , an Agreement on Social Policy was added as a protocol . <\s>
<s> Again , the UK was exempt from legislation arising from the protocol , unless it agreed to be bound by it . <\s>
<s> The protocol was to become known as `` Social Chapter '' , despite not actually being a chapter of the Maastricht Treaty . <\s>
<s> To achieve aims of the Agreement on Social Policy the European Union was to `` support and complement '' the policies of member states . <\s>
<s> The aims of the Agreement on Social Policy are . <\s>
<s> Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997 , the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy , which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the Social Chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam . <\s>
<s> The UK subsequently adopted the main legislation previously agreed under the Agreement on Social Policy , the 1994 Works Council Directive , which required workforce consultation in businesses , and the 1996 Parental Leave Directive . <\s>
<s> In the 10 years following the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam and adoption of the Social Chapter the European Union has undertaken policy initiatives in various social policy areas , including labour and industry relations , equal opportunity , health and safety , public health , protection of children , the disabled and elderly , poverty , migrant workers , education , training and youth . <\s>
<s> EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community agreement between France , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War . <\s>
<s> The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war . <\s>
<s> Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations , or mergers , and the abuse of a dominant position by companies . <\s>
<s> This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law . <\s>
<s> In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome , also known as the EC Treaty , which established the European Economic Community . <\s>
<s> The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the `` institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted '' . <\s>
<s> The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85 , which prohibited anti-competitive agreements , subject to some exemptions , and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position . <\s>
<s> The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states , with article 90 covering public undertakings , and article 92 making provisions on state aid . <\s>
<s> Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time . <\s>
<s> Today , the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101 , including price fixing . <\s>
<s> According to Article 101 any such agreements are automatically void . <\s>
<s> Article 101 establishes exemptions , if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation , gives consumers a `` fair share '' of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere . <\s>
<s> Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position , such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing . <\s>
<s> Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers between firms . <\s>
<s> The general test is whether a concentration with a community dimension might significantly impede effective competition . <\s>
<s> Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state 's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed , but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies . <\s>
<s> Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities , regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster . <\s>
<s> While the concept of a `` social market economy '' was only introduced into EU law in 2007 , free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957 . <\s>
<s> According to the standard theory of comparative advantage , two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects . <\s>
<s> Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association , or the World Trade Organisation , breaking down barriers to trade , and enhancing free movement of goods , services , labour and capital , is meant to reduce consumer prices . <\s>
<s> It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union , which led to a common market , then monetary union , then union of monetary and fiscal policy , political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state . <\s>
<s> In Europe , however , those stages were considerably mixed , and it remains unclear whether the `` endgame '' should be the same as a state , traditionally understood . <\s>
<s> In practice free trade , without standards to ensure fair trade , can benefit some people and groups within countries much more than others , but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market , particularly workers , consumers , small business , developing industries , and communities . <\s>
<s> The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU , while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons , services and capital . <\s>
<s> These so-called `` four freedoms '' were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers , technical barriers and fiscal barriers . <\s>
<s> The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit . <\s>
<s> The Treaties limit free trade , to prioritise other values such as public health , consumer protection , labour rights , fair competition , and environmental improvement . <\s>
<s> Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people 's well being . <\s>
<s> Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union , and the principle of non-discrimination . <\s>
<s> The EU manages imports from non-member states , duties between member states are prohibited , and imports circulate freely . <\s>
<s> In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34 , ' Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States ' . <\s>
<s> In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all `` trading rules '' that are `` enacted by Member States '' which could hinder trade `` directly or indirectly , actually or potentially '' would be caught by article 34 . <\s>
<s> This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful . <\s>
<s> It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in France , where they bought the Scotch . <\s>
<s> This `` wide test '' , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies , such as the former `` Buy Irish '' company that had government appointees . <\s>
<s> It also means states can be responsible for private actors . <\s>
<s> For instance , in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries , and even Belgian tomato imports . <\s>
<s> France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ' manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage . <\s>
<s> Generally speaking , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports then it must be justified under article 36 . <\s>
<s> The justifications include public morality , policy or security , `` protection of health and life of humans , animals or plants '' , `` national treasures '' of `` artistic , historic or archaeological value '' and `` industrial and commercial property . '' <\s>
<s> In addition , although not clearly listed , environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11 . <\s>
<s> More generally , it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules . <\s>
<s> So , in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13 , Brenner Autobahn , en route to Italy . <\s>
<s> Although many companies , including Mr Schmidberger 's German undertaking , were prevented from trading , the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ' fundamental pillars of a democratic society ' , against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced , and was probably subordinate . <\s>
<s> If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification , the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately . <\s>
<s> This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and be suitable to achieve the aim , be necessary , so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result , and be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36 . <\s>
<s> Often rules apply to all goods neutrally , but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products . <\s>
<s> For such `` indirect '' discriminatory measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications : either those in article 36 , or additional `` mandatory '' or `` overriding '' requirements such as consumer protection , improving labour standards , protecting the environment , press diversity , fairness in commerce , and more : the categories are not closed . <\s>
<s> In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . <\s>
<s> German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but Cassis de Dijon , which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice rejected the German government 's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought . <\s>
<s> This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product 's content or packaging . <\s>
<s> In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection . <\s>
<s> The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate : it would `` considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view '' and labelling would protect consumers `` just as effectively '' . <\s>
<s> In a 2003 case , Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as `` chocolate '' . <\s>
<s> It had to be `` chocolate substitute '' . <\s>
<s> All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , but British , Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats . <\s>
<s> They claimed the law infringed article 34 . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a `` chocolate substitute '' label . <\s>
<s> This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes . <\s>
<s> A ' neutral and objective statement ' was enough to protect consumers . <\s>
<s> If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product , this can also infringe article 34 . <\s>
<s> So , in a 2009 case , Commission v Italy , the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 . <\s>
<s> Again , the law applied neutrally to everyone , but disproportionately affected importers , because Italian companies did not make trailers . <\s>
<s> This was not a product requirement , but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it : it would have `` a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers '' that `` affects the access of that product to the market '' . <\s>
<s> It would require justification under article 36 , or as a mandatory requirement . <\s>
<s> In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access , the Court of Justice developed a presumption that `` selling arrangements '' would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34 , if they applied equally to all sellers , and affected them in the same manner in fact . <\s>
<s> In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law , which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price , was unlawful . <\s>
<s> The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition , not to hinder trade . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held , as `` in law and in fact '' it was an equally applicable `` selling arrangement '' it was outside the scope of article 34 , and so did not need to be justified . <\s>
<s> Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect `` in fact '' particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market , but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing . <\s>
<s> In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 , and misleading commercials for skin care products . <\s>
<s> While the bans have remained the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were `` the only effective form of promotion enabling to penetrate '' the market . <\s>
<s> In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio , TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' `` traditional social practices and to local habits and customs '' to buy their products , but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health . <\s>
<s> Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive , the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising , to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour , is misleading or aggressive , and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair . <\s>
<s> Increasingly , states have to give mutual recognition to each other 's standards of regulation , while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice . <\s>
<s> The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory `` race to the bottom '' , while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent . <\s>
<s> Since its foundation , the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement . <\s>
<s> Reflecting the economic nature of the project , the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers : as a `` factor of production '' . <\s>
<s> However , from the 1970s , this focus shifted towards developing a more `` social '' Europe . <\s>
<s> Free movement was increasingly based on `` citizenship '' , so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active , rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights . <\s>
<s> This means the basic `` worker '' rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21 . <\s>
<s> According to the Court of Justice , a `` worker '' is anybody who is economically active , which includes everyone in an employment relationship , `` under the direction of another person '' for `` remuneration '' . <\s>
<s> A job , however , need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker . <\s>
<s> For example , in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie , a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands , while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community , which provided for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an `` indirect quid pro quo '' for the work he did . <\s>
<s> Having `` worker '' status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments , and employers , in access to employment , tax , and social security rights . <\s>
<s> By contrast a citizen , who is `` any person having the nationality of a Member State '' , has rights to seek work , vote in local and European elections , but more restricted rights to claim social security . <\s>
<s> In practice , free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people 's jobs and benefits . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , practically `` all available research finds little impact '' of `` labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers '' . <\s>
<s> The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers . <\s>
<s> First , articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment , conclude contracts , and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state . <\s>
<s> In a famous case , the Belgian Football Association v Bosman , a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished , regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held `` the transfer rules constitute an obstacle to free movement '' and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest , but this was unlikely . <\s>
<s> In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language , but only if the measure was not disproportionate . <\s>
<s> By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano , Italy , was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice , giving `` horizontal '' direct effect to TFEU article 45 , reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate , and because it was `` impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means '' , the measure was disproportionate . <\s>
<s> Second , article 7 requires equal treatment in respect of tax . <\s>
<s> In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits to a man who worked in Germany , but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits . <\s>
<s> By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel 's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement . <\s>
<s> Although the tax was `` likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement '' , because the charge applied equally to Austrians , in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified . <\s>
<s> Third , people must receive equal treatment regarding `` social advantages '' , although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods . <\s>
<s> In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium , because the benefit was `` closely linked to the socio-economic situation '' of the Netherlands . <\s>
<s> Conversely , in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany , did not have a right to receive German child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could . <\s>
<s> The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45 are `` public policy , public security or public health '' , and there is also a general exception in article 45 for `` employment in the public service '' . <\s>
<s> Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a `` fundamental '' status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice , and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move . <\s>
<s> The Court has required that higher education , along with other forms of vocational training , should be more access , albeit with qualifying periods . <\s>
<s> In Commission v Austria the Court held that Austria was not entitled to restrict places in Austrian universities to Austrian students to avoid `` structural , staffing and financial problems '' if foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem . <\s>
<s> As well as creating rights for `` workers '' who generally lack bargaining power in the market , the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the `` freedom of establishment '' in article 49 , and `` freedom to provide services '' in article 56 . <\s>
<s> In Gebhard v Consiglio dell ' Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be `` established '' means to participate in economic life `` on a stable and continuous basis '' , while providing `` services '' meant pursuing activity more `` on a temporary basis '' . <\s>
<s> This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart , who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered , was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom , rather than service freedom . <\s>
<s> However , the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory , `` justified by imperative requirements in the general interest '' and proportionately applied . <\s>
<s> All people or entities that engage in economic activity , particularly the self-employed , or `` undertakings '' such as companies or firms , have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment , so article 49 has both `` vertical '' and `` horizontal '' direct effect . <\s>
<s> In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified . <\s>
<s> TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others ' freedom of establishment when they exercise `` official authority '' , but this did an advocate 's work was not official . <\s>
<s> By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction . <\s>
<s> The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market . <\s>
<s> Therefore , there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified . <\s>
<s> In 2006 , a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d ' Ivoire , from a European ship , prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste . <\s>
<s> Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that `` Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union '' . <\s>
<s> With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste , Franco Frattini , the Justice , Freedom and Security Commissioner , proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for `` ecological crimes '' . <\s>
<s> The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission . <\s>
<s> That ruling set a precedent that the Commission , on a supranational basis , may legislate in criminal law – something never done before . <\s>
<s> So far , the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive . <\s>
<s> Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence , but was rejected at vote . <\s>
<s> However , in October 2007 , the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be , only that there must be some . <\s>
<s> The `` freedom to provide services '' under TFEU article 56 applies to people who give services `` for remuneration '' , especially commercial or professional activity . <\s>
<s> For example , in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified : having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not . <\s>
<s> Health care generally counts as a service . <\s>
<s> In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany . <\s>
<s> The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom to provide services . <\s>
<s> Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , and should not fall within article 56 . <\s>
<s> But the Court of Justice held health was a `` service '' even though the government paid for the service . <\s>
<s> National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay , and it followed `` international medical science '' on which treatments counted as normal and necessary . <\s>
<s> The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , and this is also true in the context of the UK 's National Health Service . <\s>
<s> Aside from public services , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal . <\s>
<s> Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists going to coffee shops , fell outside article 56 altogether . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction . <\s>
<s> If an activity does fall within article 56 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice . <\s>
<s> In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën a business that sold commodities futures attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent `` undesirable developments in securities trading '' including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets . <\s>
<s> In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a `` laserdrome '' business was banned by the Bonn council . <\s>
<s> It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd , but residents had protested against `` playing at killing '' entertainment . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity , which underpinned the ban , did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services . <\s>
<s> In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people 's views were highly divergent . <\s>
<s> The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet . <\s>
<s> In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed . <\s>
<s> In regard to companies , the Court of Justice held in R v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing TFEU article 49 . <\s>
<s> This meant the Daily Mail newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK . <\s>
<s> The UK did not need to justify its action , as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised . <\s>
<s> By contrast , in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark 's minimum share capital rules . <\s>
<s> UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company , while Denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent . <\s>
<s> The Court of Justice held that Denmark 's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there , and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection . <\s>
<s> This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition , and a race to the bottom in standards , like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result . <\s>
<s> Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany . <\s>
<s> Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far : it was an `` outright negation '' of the right of establishment . <\s>
<s> However , in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law , they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose . <\s>
<s> This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary . <\s>
<s> Thus , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies , and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory , although it is not entirely clear why . <\s>
<s> The Amazon rainforest , also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America . <\s>
<s> This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres , of which 5,500,000 square kilometres are covered by the rainforest . <\s>
<s> This region includes territory belonging to nine nations . <\s>
<s> The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil , with 60 % of the rainforest , followed by Peru with 13 % , Colombia with 10 % , and with minor amounts in Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia , Guyana , Suriname and French Guiana . <\s>
<s> States or departments in four nations contain `` Amazonas '' in their names . <\s>
<s> The Amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world , with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species . <\s>
<s> Following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent . <\s>
<s> From 66–34 Mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45° . <\s>
<s> Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics . <\s>
<s> During the Oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band . <\s>
<s> It expanded again during the Middle Miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum . <\s>
<s> However , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species . <\s>
<s> During the mid-Eocene , it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch . <\s>
<s> Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic , while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin . <\s>
<s> As the Andes Mountains rose , however , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake ; now known as the Solimões Basin . <\s>
<s> Within the last 5–10 million years , this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch , joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic . <\s>
<s> There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent deglaciation . <\s>
<s> Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin . <\s>
<s> There is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was . <\s>
<s> Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . <\s>
<s> This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data . <\s>
<s> NASA 's CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon : an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year , at 15 degrees west longitude , across 1,600 miles over the Atlantic Ocean , then at 35 degrees West longitude at the eastern coast of South America , 27.7 million tons of dust fall over the Amazon basin , 132 million tons of dust remain in the air , 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea , past 75 degrees west longitude . <\s>
<s> For a long time , it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil . <\s>
<s> Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea , as described in her book Amazonia : Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise . <\s>
<s> She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population . <\s>
<s> However , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated . <\s>
<s> Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at Marajó , and inland dwellers . <\s>
<s> By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000 . <\s>
<s> The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542 . <\s>
<s> The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana , rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought , was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s . <\s>
<s> It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe , such as smallpox . <\s>
<s> Since the 1970s , numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0–1250 , furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations . <\s>
<s> Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre . <\s>
<s> The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest , rather than being a pristine wilderness , has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta . <\s>
<s> Terra preta , which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management . <\s>
<s> The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment ; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management , rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed . <\s>
<s> In the region of the Xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida . <\s>
<s> Among those were evidence of roads , bridges and large plazas . <\s>
<s> The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species , tens of thousands of plants , and some 2,000 birds and mammals . <\s>
<s> To date , at least 40,000 plant species , 2,200 fishes , 1,294 birds , 427 mammals , 428 amphibians , and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region . <\s>
<s> One in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon , and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams . <\s>
<s> Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone . <\s>
<s> The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species . <\s>
<s> A study in 1999 found one square kilometer of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants . <\s>
<s> The average plant biomass is estimated at 356 ± 47 tonnes per hectare . <\s>
<s> To date , an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued . <\s>
<s> The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000 . <\s>
<s> The rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard . <\s>
<s> Among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman , jaguar , cougar , and anaconda . <\s>
<s> In the river , electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill , while piranha are known to bite and injure humans . <\s>
<s> Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh . <\s>
<s> There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors . <\s>
<s> Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus . <\s>
<s> Malaria , yellow fever and Dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region . <\s>
<s> Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas . <\s>
<s> The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land . <\s>
<s> Prior to the early 1960s , access to the forest 's interior was highly restricted , and the forest remained basically intact . <\s>
<s> Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method . <\s>
<s> However , the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion . <\s>
<s> The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time , so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land . <\s>
<s> These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage . <\s>
<s> Deforestation is considerable , and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space . <\s>
<s> Between 1991 and 2000 , the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres , with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle . <\s>
<s> Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon , and 91 % of land deforested since 1970 , is used for livestock pasture . <\s>
<s> Currently , Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States . <\s>
<s> New research however , conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al. , has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon , the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes . <\s>
<s> So despite the popular perception , there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields . <\s>
<s> The needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the Amazon . <\s>
<s> The first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation . <\s>
<s> The mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 was 18 % higher than in the previous five years . <\s>
<s> Although deforestation has declined significantly in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2014 , there has been an increase to the present day . <\s>
<s> Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest , and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation , which could accelerate global warming . <\s>
<s> Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10 % of the world 's terrestrial primary productivity and 10 % of the carbon stores in ecosystems — of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon . <\s>
<s> Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996 . <\s>
<s> One computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures , leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100 . <\s>
<s> However , simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response , ranging from weak increases to strong decreases . <\s>
<s> The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation . <\s>
<s> As indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide , such as in the Peruvian Amazon indigenous peoples ' rainforest communities continue to disappear , while others , like the Urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories . <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland South American peoples has gained increased attention , as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts . <\s>
<s> The use of remote sensing for the conservation of the Amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests . <\s>
<s> Using handheld GPS devices and programs like Google Earth , members of the Trio Tribe , who live in the rainforests of southern Suriname , map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims . <\s>
<s> Currently , most tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries , making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories . <\s>
<s> To accurately map the Amazon 's biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions , the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial . <\s>
<s> In 2006 Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon into four categories : mature forest , regenerating forest , regenerating forest , and regenerating forest . <\s>
<s> The researcher used a combination of Synthetic aperture radar and Thematic Mapper to accurately place the different portions of the Amazon into one of the four classifications . <\s>
<s> In 2005 , parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years , and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought . <\s>
<s> A July 23 , 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought . <\s>
<s> Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response , coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate , are pushing the rainforest towards a `` tipping point '' where it would irreversibly start to die . <\s>
<s> It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert , with catastrophic consequences for the world 's climate . <\s>
<s> In 2010 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought , in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought . <\s>
<s> The affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles of rainforest , compared to 734,000 square miles in 2005 . <\s>
<s> The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off , whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part . <\s>
<s> The findings were published in the journal Science . <\s>
<s> In a typical year the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide ; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released . <\s>
<s> Ctenophora is a phylum of animals that live in marine waters worldwide . <\s>
<s> Their most distinctive feature is the ' combs ' – groups of cilia which they use for swimming – they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia . <\s>
<s> Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m in size . <\s>
<s> Like cnidarians , their bodies consist of a mass of jelly , with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity . <\s>
<s> In ctenophores , these layers are two cells deep , while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep . <\s>
<s> Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum , Coelenterata , as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration . <\s>
<s> Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla . <\s>
<s> Almost all ctenophores are predators , taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans ; the exceptions are juveniles of two species , which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed . <\s>
<s> In favorable circumstances , ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day . <\s>
<s> Only 100–150 species have been validated , and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named . <\s>
<s> The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla that are covered with colloblasts , sticky cells that capture prey . <\s>
<s> The phylum has a wide range of body forms , including the flattened , deep-sea platyctenids , in which the adults of most species lack combs , and the coastal beroids , which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large , stiffened cilia that act as teeth . <\s>
<s> These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area , because they specialize in different types of prey , which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use . <\s>
<s> Most species are hermaphrodites — a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm , meaning it can fertilize its own egg , not needing a mate . <\s>
<s> Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites , which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time . <\s>
<s> Others are sequential hermaphrodites , in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times . <\s>
<s> Fertilization is generally external , although platyctenids ' eggs are fertilized inside their parents ' bodies and kept there until they hatch . <\s>
<s> The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids , gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow . <\s>
<s> The exceptions are the beroids , whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles , and the platyctenids , whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size , but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form . <\s>
<s> In at least some species , juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape . <\s>
<s> The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations , but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find . <\s>
<s> In bays where they occur in very high numbers , predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods , which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton , which are a vital part of marine food chains . <\s>
<s> One ctenophore , Mnemiopsis , has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea , where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish . <\s>
<s> The situation was aggravated by other factors , such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population . <\s>
<s> The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem , as Beroe preys on other ctenophores . <\s>
<s> Despite their soft , gelatinous bodies , fossils thought to represent ctenophores , apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms , have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early Cambrian , about 515 million years ago . <\s>
<s> The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated , and the majority view at present , based on molecular phylogenetics , is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores . <\s>
<s> A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like , and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently , probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago . <\s>
<s> Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the `` cydippids '' are not monophyletic , in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor , because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges , about as complex as cnidarians , and less complex than bilaterians . <\s>
<s> Unlike sponges , both ctenophores and cnidarians have : cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes ; muscles ; nervous systems ; and some have sensory organs . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts , which are sticky and adhere to prey , although a few ctenophore species lack them . <\s>
<s> Like sponges and cnidarians , ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material , which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores ; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer . <\s>
<s> Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic , along with sponges . <\s>
<s> Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that , in more complex animals , arises from the middle cell layer , and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic , while others still regard them as diploblastic . <\s>
<s> Ranging from about 1 millimeter to 1.5 meters in size , ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia as their main method of locomotion . <\s>
<s> Most species have eight strips , called comb rows , that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia , called `` ctenes , '' stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat , those of each comb touch the comb below . <\s>
<s> The name `` ctenophora '' means `` comb-bearing '' , from the Greek κτείς meaning `` comb '' and the Greek suffix -φορος meaning `` carrying '' . <\s>
<s> For a phylum with relatively few species , ctenophores have a wide range of body plans . <\s>
<s> Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study . <\s>
<s> In addition oceanic species do not preserve well , and are known mainly from photographs and from observers ' notes . <\s>
<s> Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia , Beroe and Mnemiopsis . <\s>
<s> At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia . <\s>
<s> The internal cavity forms : a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles ; a pharynx ; a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach ; and a system of internal canals . <\s>
<s> These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal : the mouth and pharynx ; the roots of the tentacles , if present ; all along the underside of each comb row ; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores . <\s>
<s> The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium , the gastrodermis . <\s>
<s> The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles . <\s>
<s> In other parts of the canal system , the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies . <\s>
<s> The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles , germ cells that produce eggs or sperm , and photocytes that produce bioluminescence . <\s>
<s> The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals , punctuated by ciliary rosettes , pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea . <\s>
<s> The outer surface bears usually eight comb rows , called swimming-plates , which are used for swimming . <\s>
<s> The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth to the opposite end , and are spaced more or less evenly around the body , although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth . <\s>
<s> The `` combs '' run across each row , and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters . <\s>
<s> Unlike conventional cilia and flagella , which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern , these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern , where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function . <\s>
<s> These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth , although they can also reverse direction . <\s>
<s> Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing , unlike jellyfish . <\s>
<s> When trying to escape predators , one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed ; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior , by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia . <\s>
<s> It is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy , but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities . <\s>
<s> Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater . <\s>
<s> If they enter less dense brackish water , the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density , to avoid sinking . <\s>
<s> Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater , the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density . <\s>
<s> The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ . <\s>
<s> Its main component is a statocyst , a balance sensor consisting of a statolith , a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia , called `` balancers '' , that sense its orientation . <\s>
<s> The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long , immobile cilia . <\s>
<s> A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers . <\s>
<s> Instead its response is determined by the animal 's `` mood '' , in other words the overall state of the nervous system . <\s>
<s> For example , if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey , it will often put some comb rows into reverse , spinning the mouth towards the prey . <\s>
<s> Cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded , sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped ; the common coastal `` sea gooseberry , '' Pleurobrachia , sometimes has an egg-shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end , although some individuals are more uniformly round . <\s>
<s> From opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long , slender tentacles , each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn . <\s>
<s> Some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents , so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles . <\s>
<s> The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . <\s>
<s> The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it . <\s>
<s> Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . <\s>
<s> The function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart . <\s>
<s> In addition to colloblasts , members of the genus Haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense . <\s>
<s> The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . <\s>
<s> Euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey . <\s>
<s> The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle . <\s>
<s> The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type . <\s>
<s> Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle . <\s>
<s> There are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end , and are spaced evenly round the body . <\s>
<s> The `` combs '' beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a Mexican wave . <\s>
<s> From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows , and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows . <\s>
<s> This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers , via water disturbances created by the cilia . <\s>
<s> The Lobata have a pair of lobes , which are muscular , cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth . <\s>
<s> Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth , running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes . <\s>
<s> Between the lobes on either side of the mouth , many species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth . <\s>
<s> This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey . <\s>
<s> Lobates have eight comb-rows , originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes ; in species with auricles , the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows . <\s>
<s> Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water , using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion , although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion . <\s>
<s> Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes , so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly . <\s>
<s> Unlike cydippids , the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids . <\s>
<s> This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like . <\s>
<s> The Beroida , also known as Nuda , have no feeding appendages , but their large pharynx , just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body , bears `` macrocilia '' at the oral end . <\s>
<s> These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to `` bite '' off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores . <\s>
<s> In front of the field of macrocilia , on the mouth `` lips '' in some species of Beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that `` zip '' the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip . <\s>
<s> This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey . <\s>
<s> The Cestida are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon . <\s>
<s> There is a pair of comb-rows along each aboral edge , and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge , which stream back across most of the wing-like body surface . <\s>
<s> Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows . <\s>
<s> There are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm-temperate waters : Cestum veneris is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1.5 meters long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly . <\s>
<s> Velamen parallelum , which is typically less than 20 centimeters long , can move much faster in what has been described as a `` darting motion '' . <\s>
<s> Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface . <\s>
<s> They cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular `` foot '' . <\s>
<s> All but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows . <\s>
<s> Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current . <\s>
<s> Almost all species are hermaphrodites , in other words they function as both males and females at the same time – except that in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives . <\s>
<s> The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis . <\s>
<s> Fertilization is external in most species , but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch . <\s>
<s> Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile . <\s>
<s> Development of the fertilized eggs is direct , in other words there is no distinctive larval form , and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults . <\s>
<s> In the genus Beroe the juveniles , like the adults , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths . <\s>
<s> In most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents . <\s>
<s> In some groups , such as the flat , bottom-dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea-floor . <\s>
<s> When some species , including Bathyctena chuni , Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera , are disturbed , they produce secretions that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies . <\s>
<s> Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults , whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies . <\s>
<s> Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores ' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals ' environments , such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters . <\s>
<s> Almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic . <\s>
<s> If food is plentiful , they can eat 10 times their own weight per day . <\s>
<s> While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores , other surface-water species prey on zooplankton ranging in size from the microscopic , including mollusc and fish larvae , to small adult crustaceans such as copepods , amphipods , and even krill . <\s>
<s> Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as `` webs '' , some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders , and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread , as bolas spiders do . <\s>
<s> This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species . <\s>
<s> The two-tentacled `` cydippid '' Lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies , and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow . <\s>
<s> Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : Pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores used to be regarded as `` dead ends '' in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals . <\s>
<s> It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators , although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue . <\s>
<s> Detailed investigation of chum salmon , Oncorhynchus keta , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around . <\s>
<s> Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores . <\s>
<s> Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores , and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations . <\s>
<s> Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population , most fish that prey on them are generalists , and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters . <\s>
<s> This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea . <\s>
<s> The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores , as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish . <\s>
<s> Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories , as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities . <\s>
<s> The impact was increased by chronic overfishing , and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost , causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores . <\s>
<s> Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism . <\s>
<s> However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels . <\s>
<s> Because of their soft , gelatinous bodies , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten , places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue . <\s>
<s> Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known , both members of the crown group , from the early Devonian period . <\s>
<s> Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period . <\s>
<s> All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species . <\s>
<s> They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores . <\s>
<s> One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth , apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular . <\s>
<s> Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian , but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil 's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes . <\s>
<s> The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly . <\s>
<s> The early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil Stromatoveris , from China 's Chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago , is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period . <\s>
<s> De-Gan Shu , Simon Conway Morris et al. found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia , used for filter feeding . <\s>
<s> They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary `` aunt '' of ctenophores , and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system . <\s>
<s> The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity . <\s>
<s> It has been the focus of debate for many years . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria , sister to the Cnidaria , sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria , and sister to all other animal phyla . <\s>
<s> A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios , that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla . <\s>
<s> Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals . <\s>
<s> This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage . <\s>
<s> However , other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that Porifera is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead . <\s>
<s> Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes . <\s>
<s> Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles . <\s>
<s> Richard Harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid . <\s>
<s> Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids . <\s>
<s> He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like . <\s>
<s> A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 , using 26 species , including 4 recently discovered ones , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like . <\s>
<s> It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata , Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain . <\s>
<s> This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished . <\s>
<s> When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla , it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain . <\s>
<s> Fresno , the county seat of Fresno County , is a city in the U.S. state of California . <\s>
<s> As of 2015 , the city 's population was 520,159 , making it the fifth-largest city in California , the largest inland city in California and the 34th-largest in the nation . <\s>
<s> Fresno is in the center of the San Joaquin Valley and is the largest city in the Central Valley , which contains the San Joaquin Valley . <\s>
<s> It is approximately 220 miles northwest of Los Angeles , 170 miles south of the state capital , Sacramento , or 185 miles south of San Francisco . <\s>
<s> The name Fresno means `` ash tree '' in Spanish , and an ash leaf is featured on the city 's flag . <\s>
<s> In 1872 , the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near Easterby 's — by now a hugely productive wheat farm — for its new Southern Pacific line . <\s>
<s> Soon there was a store around the station and the store grew the town of Fresno Station , later called Fresno . <\s>
<s> Many Millerton residents , drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding , moved to the new community . <\s>
<s> Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885 . <\s>
<s> By 1931 the Fresno Traction Company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track . <\s>
<s> Before World War II , Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods , including Little Armenia , German Town , Little Italy , and Chinatown . <\s>
<s> In 1940 , the Census Bureau reported Fresno 's population as 94.0 % white , 3.3 % black and 2.7 % Asian . <\s>
<s> Incongruously , Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today Japanese-American businesses still remain . <\s>
<s> During 1942 , Pinedale , in what is now North Fresno , was the site of the Pinedale Assembly Center , an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps . <\s>
<s> The Fresno Fairgrounds was also utilized as an assembly center . <\s>
<s> In September 1958 , Bank of America launched a new product called BankAmericard in Fresno . <\s>
<s> After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned , BankAmericard went on to become the first successful credit card ; that is , a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance . <\s>
<s> In 1976 , BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as Visa Inc . <\s>
<s> In the 1970s , the city was the subject of a song , `` Walking Into Fresno '' , written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous `` WWVA Jamboree '' radio and television show in Wheeling , West Virginia . <\s>
<s> Aken , adopted by Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga , grew up in the neighboring town of Madera and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child . <\s>
<s> Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn . <\s>
<s> Fresno has three large public parks , two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest . <\s>
<s> Woodward Park , which features the Shinzen Japanese Gardens , numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails , is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway . <\s>
<s> Roeding Park , near Downtown Fresno , is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo , and Rotary Storyland and Playland . <\s>
<s> Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region 's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited , the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S . <\s>
<s> Between the 1880s and World War II , Downtown Fresno flourished , filled with electric Street Cars , and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley 's most beautiful architectural buildings . <\s>
<s> Among them , the original Fresno County Courthouse , the Fresno Carnegie Public Library , the Fresno Water Tower , the Bank of Italy Building , the Pacific Southwest Building , the San Joaquin Light & Power Building , and the Hughes Hotel , to name a few . <\s>
<s> Fulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno 's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation 's first pedestrian malls in 1964 . <\s>
<s> Renamed the Fulton Mall , the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno . <\s>
<s> While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday , the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country , including the only Pierre-Auguste Renoir piece in the world that one can walk up to and touch . <\s>
<s> Current plans call for the reopening of the Fulton Mall to automobile traffic . <\s>
<s> The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district . <\s>
<s> The neighborhood of Sunnyside is on Fresno 's far southeast side , bounded by Chestnut Avenue to the West . <\s>
<s> Its major thoroughfares are Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue . <\s>
<s> Although parts of Sunnyside are within the City of Fresno , much of the neighborhood is a `` county island '' within Fresno County . <\s>
<s> Largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s , it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction . <\s>
<s> It is also the home of the Sunnyside Country Club , which maintains a golf course designed by William P. Bell . <\s>
<s> The popular neighborhood known as the Tower District is centered around the historic Tower Theatre , which is included on the National List of Historic Places . <\s>
<s> The theater was built in 1939 and is at Olive and Wishon Avenues in the heart of the Tower District . <\s>
<s> The name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower , which is actually in another nearby area . <\s>
<s> The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper , and one-half mile south of Fresno City College . <\s>
<s> Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior , the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II . <\s>
<s> The character of small local businesses largely remains today . <\s>
<s> To some extent , the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School . <\s>
<s> In 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north of the Tower District . <\s>
<s> This vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s . <\s>
<s> After decades of neglect and suburban flight , the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s , which at that time showed second and third run movies , along with classic films . <\s>
<s> Roger Rocka 's Dinner Theater & Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978 , at Olive and Wishon Avenues . <\s>
<s> Fresno native Audra McDonald performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student . <\s>
<s> McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on Broadway in New York City and a Tony award winning actress . <\s>
<s> Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players ' 2nd Space Theatre . <\s>
<s> The neighborhood features restaurants , live theater and nightclubs , as well as several independent shops and bookstores , currently operating on or near Olive Avenue , and all within a few hundred feet of each other . <\s>
<s> Since renewal , the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses . <\s>
<s> Today , the Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno 's LGBT and hipster Communities . <\s>
<s> Additionally , Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno 's local punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal community . <\s>
<s> The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes , many of which have been restored in recent decades . <\s>
<s> The area includes many California Bungalow and American Craftsman style homes , Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture , Mediterranean Revival Style architecture , Mission Revival Style architecture , and many Storybook houses designed by Fresno architects , Hilliard , Taylor & Wheeler . <\s>
<s> The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of Fresno . <\s>
<s> Homes from the early 20th century line this boulevard in the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract . <\s>
<s> The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large , stately homes . <\s>
<s> The original development of this area began circa 1910 , on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field . <\s>
<s> The Alta Vista Tract , as the land would become known , was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation , and was officially platted in 1911 . <\s>
<s> The tract 's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south , Cedar Avenue on the east , the rear property line of Platt Avenue and Platt Avenue on the north , and First Street on the west . <\s>
<s> The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912 , in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community . <\s>
<s> At the time of its admission to the City , the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped , although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon . <\s>
<s> In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract , completed street development , provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service , and began marketing the property with fervor . <\s>
<s> A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes . <\s>
<s> This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard , which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital . <\s>
<s> The `` West Side '' of Fresno , also often called `` Southwest Fresno '' , is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city . <\s>
<s> The neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway , west of the 41 freeway and south of Nielsen Ave , and extends to the city limits to the west and south . <\s>
<s> The neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of Fresno 's African-American community . <\s>
<s> It is culturally diverse and also includes significant Mexican-American and Asian-American populations . <\s>
<s> The neighborhood includes Kearney Boulevard , named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire M. Theo Kearney , which extends from Fresno Street in Southwest Fresno about 20 mi west to Kerman , California . <\s>
<s> A small , two-lane rural road for most of its length , Kearney Boulevard is lined with tall palm trees . <\s>
<s> The roughly half-mile stretch of Kearney Boulevard between Fresno Street and Thorne Ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for Fresno 's elite African-American families . <\s>
<s> Another section , Brookhaven , on the southern edge of the West Side south of Jensen and west of Elm , was given the name by the Fresno City Council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood 's image . <\s>
<s> The isolated subdivision was for years known as the `` Dogg Pound '' in reference to a local gang , and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime . <\s>
<s> While many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before , the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the Fresno Housing Authority . <\s>
<s> The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has also built small subdivisions of single-family homes in the area for purchase by low-income working families . <\s>
<s> There have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood , including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of Fresno and B streets , an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood , and some new section 8 apartments have been built along Church Ave west of Elm St . <\s>
<s> Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood , and the stench from these has long plagued area residents . <\s>
<s> The Fresno Chandler Executive Airport is also on the West Side . <\s>
<s> Due to its position on the edge of the city and years of neglect by developers , is not a true `` inner-city '' neighborhood , and there are many vacant lots , strawberry fields and vineyards throughout the neighborhood . <\s>
<s> The neighborhood has very little retail activity , aside from the area near Fresno Street and State Route 99 Freeway and small corner markets scattered throughout . <\s>
<s> In the north eastern part of Fresno , Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward , a long-time Fresno resident . <\s>
<s> He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno . <\s>
<s> The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road . <\s>
<s> The initial 235 acres , combined with additional acres acquired later by the City , brings the park to a sizable 300 acres . <\s>
<s> Now packed with amenities , Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley . <\s>
<s> The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing . <\s>
<s> The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people , authentic Japanese Garden , fenced dog park , two-mile equestrian trail , exercise par course , three children 's playgrounds , a lake , 3 small ponds , 7 picnic areas and five miles of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway 's Lewis S. Eaton Trail . <\s>
<s> When complete , the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles between Highway 99 and Friant Dam . <\s>
<s> The park 's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life . <\s>
<s> The park 's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010 , and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones , Tech N9ne , and Sevendust as well as numerous others . <\s>
<s> The park is open April through October , 6am to 10pm and November through March , 6am to 7pm . <\s>

<s> Formed in 1946 , Sierra Sky Park Airport is a residential airport community born of a unique agreement in transportation law to allow personal aircraft and automobiles to share certain roads . <\s>
<s> Sierra Sky Park was the first aviation community to be built and there are now numerous such communities across the United States and around the world . <\s>
<s> Developer William Smilie created the nation 's first planned aviation community . <\s>
<s> Still in operation today , the public use airport provides a unique neighborhood that spawned interest and similar communities nationwide . <\s>
<s> Fresno is marked by a semi-arid climate , with mild , moist winters and hot and dry summers , thus displaying Mediterranean characteristics . <\s>
<s> December and January are the coldest months , and average around 46.5 °F , and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually , with the coldest night of the year typically bottoming out below 30 °F . <\s>
<s> July is the warmest month , averaging 83.0 °F ; normally , there are 32 days of 100 °F + highs and 106 days of 90 °F + highs , and in July and August , there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 °F . <\s>
<s> Summers provide considerable sunshine , with July peaking at 97 percent of the total possible sunlight hours ; conversely , January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of thick tule fog . <\s>
<s> However , the year averages 81 % of possible sunshine , for a total of 3550 hours . <\s>
<s> Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches , which , by definition , would classify the area as a semidesert . <\s>
<s> Most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest , as winds are driven downward along the axis of the California Central Valley ; in December , January and February there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics . <\s>
<s> Fresno meteorology was selected in a national U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study for analysis of equilibrium temperature for use of ten-year meteorological data to represent a warm , dry western United States locale . <\s>

<s> Fresno is served by State Route 99 , the main north/south freeway that connects the major population centers of the California Central Valley . <\s>
<s> State Route 168 , the Sierra Freeway , heads east to the city of Clovis and Huntington Lake . <\s>
<s> State Route 41 comes into Fresno from Atascadero in the south , and then heads north to Yosemite . <\s>
<s> State Route 180 comes from the west via Mendota , and from the east in Kings Canyon National Park going towards the city of Reedley . <\s>
<s> Fresno is the largest U.S. city not directly linked to an Interstate highway . <\s>
<s> When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s , the decision was made to build what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley , and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region , instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99 . <\s>
<s> Due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99 , as well as the desirability of Federal funding , much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system , most likely as Interstate 9 . <\s>
<s> Major improvements to signage , lane width , median separation , vertical clearance , and other concerns are currently underway . <\s>
<s> Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak San Joaquins . <\s>
<s> The main passenger rail station is the recently renovated historic Santa Fe Railroad Depot in Downtown Fresno . <\s>
<s> The Bakersfield-Stockton mainlines of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and Union Pacific Railroad railroads cross in Fresno , and both railroads maintain railyards within the city ; the San Joaquin Valley Railroad also operates former Southern Pacific branchlines heading west and south out of the city . <\s>
<s> The city of Fresno is planned to serve the future California High Speed Rail . <\s>
<s> Starting in the late 1950s , American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant , efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation , funded by the US Department of Defense . <\s>
<s> This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth , largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System . <\s>
<s> The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory in the late 1960s . <\s>
<s> Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following , including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States . <\s>
<s> Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm , circuit switching , a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session , each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes . <\s>
<s> In cases of billable services , such as cellular communication services , circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred , while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages . <\s>
<s> Packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes . <\s>
<s> Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing , traffic shaping , or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service , such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket . <\s>
<s> In case of a shared physical medium , the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme . <\s>
<s> Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks , first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265 , later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962 , and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964 . <\s>
<s> Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale , distributed , survivable communications network . <\s>
<s> The work focuses on three key ideas : use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks , later called packets , and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching . <\s>
<s> Starting in 1965 , Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory , UK , independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by Baran . <\s>
<s> He called it packet switching , a more accessible name than Baran 's , and proposed to build a nationwide network in the UK . <\s>
<s> He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966 , after which a person from the Ministry of Defence told him about Baran 's work . <\s>
<s> A member of Davies ' team met Lawrence Roberts at the 1967 ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles and suggested it for use in the ARPANET . <\s>
<s> In connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information . <\s>
<s> The packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery . <\s>
<s> Each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . <\s>
<s> It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet . <\s>
<s> This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination , but means that much more information is needed in the packet header , which is therefore larger , and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory . <\s>
<s> Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes ; potentially , the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up , but with less information as to the application 's requirements . <\s>
<s> At the destination , the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number . <\s>
<s> Thus a virtual connection , also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol , although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service . <\s>
<s> Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication . <\s>
<s> The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking . <\s>
<s> Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase , when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes . <\s>
<s> The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters . <\s>
<s> Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated . <\s>
<s> Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table . <\s>
<s> The packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , timestamp , or sequence number , which is different for different packets . <\s>
<s> Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations . <\s>
<s> But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model . <\s>
<s> Frame Relay does it at level two , the data link layer . <\s>
<s> Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted . <\s>
<s> Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes . <\s>
<s> X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network . <\s>
<s> It only operates at the user-network-interface . <\s>
<s> Thus , the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network . <\s>
<s> X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI , and its link layer protocol provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures . <\s>
<s> Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN 's layer two protocol , LAPD and LAPB . <\s>
<s> As such , its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link , not end-to-end . <\s>
<s> Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols . <\s>
<s> The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite , which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model . <\s>
<s> It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s , to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks . <\s>
<s> Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well , but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient . <\s>
<s> Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model . <\s>
<s> However , its address field can be used at the OSI network layer , with a minimum set of procedures . <\s>
<s> Thus , it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances , but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol . <\s>
<s> The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25 . <\s>
<s> Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol , like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations . <\s>
<s> For X.25 its packet IDs , the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses . <\s>
<s> The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI . <\s>
<s> How this is done is up to the network provider . <\s>
<s> Frame Relay , by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two , by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode . <\s>
<s> X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session , but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake . <\s>
<s> For a while , Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks . <\s>
<s> However , X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol at the network layer , and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching at layer two . <\s>
<s> A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS . <\s>
<s> ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969 . <\s>
<s> Before the introduction of X.25 in 1973 , about twenty different network technologies had been developed . <\s>
<s> Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core . <\s>
<s> In the datagram system , the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets . <\s>
<s> The User Datagram Protocol is an example of a datagram protocol . <\s>
<s> In the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host . <\s>
<s> This results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model . <\s>
<s> The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type . <\s>
<s> AppleTalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc. in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers . <\s>
<s> It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 90s . <\s>
<s> AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server . <\s>
<s> The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses , updated the distributed namespace , and configured any required inter-network routing . <\s>
<s> It was a plug-n-play system . <\s>
<s> The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin . <\s>
<s> First demonstrated in 1973 , it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally . <\s>
<s> It was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , rather than the network itself , using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms . <\s>
<s> Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture . <\s>
<s> DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation , originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers . <\s>
<s> It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures , thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s . <\s>
<s> Initially built with three layers , it later evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol . <\s>
<s> The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation . <\s>
<s> However , DECnet Phase II were open standards with published specifications , and several implementations were developed outside DEC , including one for Linux . <\s>
<s> In 1965 , at the instigation of Warner Sinback , a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE 's four computer sales and service centers to facilitate a computer time-sharing service , apparently the world 's first commercial online service . <\s>
<s> In addition to selling GE computers , the centers were computer service bureaus , offering batch processing services . <\s>
<s> They lost money from the beginning , and Sinback , a high-level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around . <\s>
<s> He decided that a time-sharing system , based on Kemney 's work at Dartmouth , which used a computer on loan from GE , could be profitable . <\s>
<s> Warner was right . <\s>
<s> Merit Network , Inc. , an independent non-profit 501 corporation governed by Michigan 's public universities , was formed in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad to explore computer networking between three of Michigan 's public universities as a means to help the state 's educational and economic development . <\s>
<s> With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation , the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit . <\s>
<s> In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad . <\s>
<s> Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections , host to host batch connections , interactive file transfer , gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks , X.25 host attachments , gateways to X.25 data networks , Ethernet attached hosts , and eventually TCP/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network . <\s>
<s> All of this set the stage for Merit 's role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s . <\s>
<s> Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States . <\s>
<s> It was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts as a means of making ARPANET technology public . <\s>
<s> He had tried to interest AT & T in buying the technology , but the monopoly 's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future . <\s>
<s> Bolt , Beranack and Newman provided the financing . <\s>
<s> It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29 . <\s>
<s> Telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the CCITT . <\s>
<s> Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975 . <\s>
<s> It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE . <\s>
<s> Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose , CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X.25 , SNA/SDLC , BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers at thousands of large companies , educational institutions , and government agencies . <\s>
<s> Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections . <\s>
<s> The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies to build their own dedicated networks . <\s>
<s> The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network . <\s>
<s> Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways . <\s>
<s> Interesting note : Tymnet was not named after Mr. Tyme . <\s>
<s> Another employee suggested the name . <\s>
<s> There were two kinds of X.25 networks . <\s>
<s> Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface . <\s>
<s> Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes . <\s>
<s> DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada and Northern Telecom . <\s>
<s> Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost . <\s>
<s> X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks . <\s>
<s> A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address . <\s>
<s> AUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra . <\s>
<s> Started by Telecom Australia in the early 1980s , AUSTPAC was Australia 's first public packet-switched data network , supporting applications such as on-line betting , financial applications — the Australian Tax Office made use of AUSTPAC — and remote terminal access to academic institutions , who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases . <\s>
<s> Access can be via a dial-up terminal to a PAD , or , by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network . <\s>
<s> Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom . <\s>
<s> Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines , the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad . <\s>
<s> And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well . <\s>
<s> Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion . <\s>
<s> The Computer Science Network was a computer network funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation that began operation in 1981 . <\s>
<s> Its purpose was to extend networking benefits , for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET , due to funding or authorization limitations . <\s>
<s> It played a significant role in spreading awareness of , and access to , national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet . <\s>
<s> Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities , industry , and government . <\s>
<s> The Internet2 community , in partnership with Qwest , built the first Internet2 Network , called Abilene , in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail project . <\s>
<s> In 2006 , Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network , boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s . <\s>
<s> In October , 2007 , Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new , higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network . <\s>
<s> The National Science Foundation Network was a program of coordinated , evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States . <\s>
<s> NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks operating at speeds of 56 kbit/s , 1.5 Mbit/s , and 45 Mbit/s that were constructed to support NSF 's networking initiatives from 1985-1995 . <\s>
<s> Initially created to link researchers to the nation 's NSF-funded supercomputing centers , through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone . <\s>
<s> The Very high-speed Backbone Network Service came on line in April 1995 as part of a National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States . <\s>
<s> The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF . <\s>
<s> By 1998 , the vBNS had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with DS-3 , OC-3c , and OC-12c links on an all OC-12c backbone , a substantial engineering feat for that time . <\s>
<s> The vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48c IP links in February 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48c . <\s>
<s> The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of Central Asia , where it then travelled along the Silk Road , reaching Crimea by 1343 . <\s>
<s> From there , it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships . <\s>
<s> Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe , the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60 % of Europe 's total population . <\s>
<s> In total , the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century . <\s>
<s> The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century . <\s>
<s> The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century . <\s>
<s> The plague disease , caused by Yersinia pestis , is enzootic in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents , including marmots , in various areas including Central Asia , Kurdistan , Western Asia , Northern India and Uganda . <\s>
<s> Nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic , from which it could easily have spread to China and India . <\s>
<s> In October 2010 , medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China . <\s>
<s> In China , the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading . <\s>
<s> However , economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century . <\s>
<s> In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine , starting in 1331 , with a deadly plague arriving soon after . <\s>
<s> Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347 . <\s>
<s> Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347 . <\s>
<s> After a protracted siege , during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease , the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants . <\s>
<s> The Genoese traders fled , taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe , whence it spread north . <\s>
<s> Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate , it is clear that several existing conditions such as war , famine , and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death . <\s>
<s> From Italy , the disease spread northwest across Europe , striking France , Spain , Portugal and England by June 1348 , then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350 . <\s>
<s> It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Askøy , then spread to Bjørgvin and Iceland . <\s>
<s> Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351 . <\s>
<s> The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours , including the Kingdom of Poland , the majority of the Basque Country , isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands , and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent . <\s>
<s> The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic , leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures . <\s>
<s> As it spread to western Europe , the disease entered the region from southern Russia also . <\s>
<s> By autumn 1347 , the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt , probably through the port 's trade with Constantinople , and ports on the Black Sea . <\s>
<s> During 1347 , the disease travelled eastward to Gaza , and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon , Syria and Palestine , including Ashkelon , Acre , Jerusalem , Sidon , Damascus , Homs , and Aleppo . <\s>
<s> In 1348–49 , the disease reached Antioch . <\s>
<s> The city 's residents fled to the north , most of them dying during the journey , but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor . <\s>
<s> Gasquet claimed that the Latin name atra mors for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I. Pontanus : Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant . <\s>
<s> Commonly and from its effects , they called it the black death . <\s>
<s> The name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany , gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name . <\s>
<s> In England , it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death . <\s>
<s> Medical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages . <\s>
<s> The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens , in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a `` great pestilence in the air '' . <\s>
<s> This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers . <\s>
<s> That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory . <\s>
<s> Today , this is known as the Miasma theory . <\s>
<s> The word ' plague ' had no special significance at this time , and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term . <\s>
<s> The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory , which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis , also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865 , eventually spreading to India . <\s>
<s> The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894 , among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin , after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis . <\s>
<s> The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host . <\s>
<s> This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas , which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation , resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site , infecting the host . <\s>
<s> The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents : one resistant to the disease , which act as hosts , keeping the disease endemic , and a second that lack resistance . <\s>
<s> When the second population dies , the fleas move on to other hosts , including people , thus creating a human epidemic . <\s>
<s> The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the ' Great Pestilence ' in 1893 and suggested that `` it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague '' . <\s>
<s> He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908 , implicating rats and fleas in the process , and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics , such as the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700 CE . <\s>
<s> Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists . <\s>
<s> The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75 % and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C , headaches , painful aching joints , nausea and vomiting , and a general feeling of malaise . <\s>
<s> Left untreated , of those that contract the bubonic plague , 80 percent die within eight days . <\s>
<s> Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent . <\s>
<s> Symptoms include fever , cough , and blood-tinged sputum . <\s>
<s> As the disease progresses , sputum becomes free flowing and bright red . <\s>
<s> Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms , with a mortality rate near 100 % . <\s>
<s> Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches . <\s>
<s> In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague , the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes . <\s>
<s> The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades of the Y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves . <\s>
<s> These clades were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis , suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves . <\s>
<s> Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years , eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349 , where it spread through the country in three epidemics . <\s>
<s> Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France , implying Bergen op Zoom was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague , different from those in Britain and France , may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway , the Hanseatic cities or another site . <\s>
<s> The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended . <\s>
<s> Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England , Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 `` that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no longer exist . '' <\s>
<s> A study published in Nature in October 2011 sequenced the genome of Y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease . <\s>
<s> It is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms , but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period . <\s>
<s> Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England , and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100 % as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377 . <\s>
<s> Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy . <\s>
<s> In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique ; that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance ; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples from other mass graves . <\s>
<s> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries ; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas ; that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague ; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high ; that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas ; and that the pattern of the Black Death , with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years , differs from modern bubonic plague — which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups . <\s>
<s> A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward . <\s>
<s> Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax , and Norman Cantor thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics . <\s>
<s> Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola . <\s>
<s> Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats ; he argues that transmission must have been person to person . <\s>
<s> However , no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance . <\s>
<s> Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases , including typhus , smallpox and respiratory infections . <\s>
<s> In addition to the bubonic infection , others point to additional septicemic and pneumonic forms of the plague , which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms . <\s>
<s> In 2014 , scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London , as well as of wills registered in London during the period , which supported the pneumonic hypothesis . <\s>
<s> The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East , including Iraq , Iran and Syria , during this time , is for a death rate of about a third . <\s>
<s> The Black Death killed about 40 % of Egypt 's population . <\s>
<s> Half of Paris 's population of 100,000 people died . <\s>
<s> In Italy , the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351 . <\s>
<s> At least 60 % of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished , and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well . <\s>
<s> Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time . <\s>
<s> Before 1350 , there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany , and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450 . <\s>
<s> In 1348 , the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins , about a third of the European population had already perished . <\s>
<s> In crowded cities , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 % of the population to die . <\s>
<s> The disease bypassed some areas , and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion . <\s>
<s> Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death . <\s>
<s> The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries . <\s>
<s> According to Biraben , the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671 . <\s>
<s> The Second Pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years : 1360–63 ; 1374 ; 1400 ; 1438–39 ; 1456–57 ; 1464–66 ; 1481–85 ; 1500–03 ; 1518–31 ; 1544–48 ; 1563–66 ; 1573–88 ; 1596–99 ; 1602–11 ; 1623–40 ; 1644–54 ; and 1664–67 . <\s>
<s> Subsequent outbreaks , though severe , marked the retreat from most of Europe and northern Africa . <\s>
<s> According to Geoffrey Parker , `` France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31 . '' <\s>
<s> In England , in the absence of census figures , historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300 , and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million . <\s>
<s> By the end of 1350 , the Black Death subsided , but it never really died out in England . <\s>
<s> Over the next few hundred years , further outbreaks occurred in 1361–62 , 1369 , 1379–83 , 1389–93 , and throughout the first half of the 15th century . <\s>
<s> An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15 % of the population , while the death rate of the plague of 1479–80 could have been as high as 20 % . <\s>
<s> The most general outbreaks in Tudor and Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498 , 1535 , 1543 , 1563 , 1589 , 1603 , 1625 , and 1636 , and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665 . <\s>
<s> In 1466 , perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris . <\s>
<s> During the 16th and 17th centuries , the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time . <\s>
<s> The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia , where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490 . <\s>
<s> Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563 , 1593 , 1603 , 1625 , 1636 , and 1665 , reducing its population by 10 to 30 % during those years . <\s>
<s> Over 10 % of Amsterdam 's population died in 1623–25 , and again in 1635–36 , 1655 , and 1664 . <\s>
<s> Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528 . <\s>
<s> The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice , almost a third of the population . <\s>
<s> Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631 , which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years ' War , and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679 . <\s>
<s> Over 60 % of Norway 's population died in 1348–50 . <\s>
<s> The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654 . <\s>
<s> In the first half of the 17th century , a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy , or about 14 % of the population . <\s>
<s> In 1656 , the plague killed about half of Naples ' 300,000 inhabitants . <\s>
<s> More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain . <\s>
<s> The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half . <\s>
<s> In 1709–13 , a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War killed about 100,000 in Sweden , and 300,000 in Prussia . <\s>
<s> The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki , and claimed a third of Stockholm 's population . <\s>
<s> Europe 's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseille . <\s>
<s> The Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world . <\s>
<s> Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850 . <\s>
<s> Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa . <\s>
<s> Algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620–21 , and again in 1654–57 , 1665 , 1691 , and 1740–42 . <\s>
<s> Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century . <\s>
<s> Between 1701 and 1750 , thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople , and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800 . <\s>
<s> Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague , and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out . <\s>
<s> There are three major types of rock : igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic . <\s>
<s> The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock , and magma . <\s>
<s> When a rock crystallizes from melt , it is an igneous rock . <\s>
<s> This rock can be weathered and eroded , and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock , or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric . <\s>
<s> The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered , eroded , deposited , and lithified , ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock . <\s>
<s> Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited , and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism . <\s>
<s> All three types of rocks may be re-melted ; when this happens , a new magma is formed , from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize . <\s>
<s> In the 1960s , a series of discoveries , the most important of which was seafloor spreading , showed that the Earth 's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle , which is called the asthenosphere . <\s>
<s> There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle : oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction , because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle . <\s>
<s> This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics . <\s>
<s> The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth . <\s>
<s> Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries . <\s>
<s> Mid-ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart . <\s>
<s> Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , where one plate subducts under another . <\s>
<s> Transform boundaries , such as the San Andreas fault system , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes . <\s>
<s> Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time . <\s>
<s> They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation , and a new setting for the observations of structural geology . <\s>
<s> The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle . <\s>
<s> Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth . <\s>
<s> Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core and a dense solid inner core . <\s>
<s> These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth , with a crust and lithosphere on top , the mantle below , and the outer core and inner core below that . <\s>
<s> More recently , seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan . <\s>
<s> These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth , and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model . <\s>
<s> The following four timelines show the geologic time scale . <\s>
<s> The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present , but this compresses the most recent eon . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale . <\s>
<s> The second scale compresses the most recent era , so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale . <\s>
<s> Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs , it is further expanded in the fourth scale . <\s>
<s> The second , third , and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks . <\s>
<s> The Holocene is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right , another reason for expanding the fourth scale . <\s>
<s> The Pleistocene epoch . <\s>
<s> Q stands for the Quaternary period . <\s>
<s> The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut . <\s>
<s> Faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault . <\s>
<s> Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault . <\s>
<s> The principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them . <\s>
<s> For example , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer . <\s>
<s> A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found . <\s>
<s> These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix . <\s>
<s> As a result , xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them . <\s>
<s> The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks . <\s>
<s> As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world , their presence or absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found . <\s>
<s> Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought . <\s>
<s> The principle becomes quite complex , however , given the uncertainties of fossilization , the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat , and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time . <\s>
<s> At the beginning of the 20th century , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods . <\s>
<s> This changed the understanding of geologic time . <\s>
<s> Previously , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another . <\s>
<s> With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages . <\s>
<s> For many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature , the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice . <\s>
<s> These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies . <\s>
<s> Common methods include uranium-lead dating , potassium-argon dating , argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating . <\s>
<s> These methods are used for a variety of applications . <\s>
<s> Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques . <\s>
<s> These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement . <\s>
<s> Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography . <\s>
<s> When rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker . <\s>
<s> Because rock units , other than muds , do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding . <\s>
<s> In the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock . <\s>
<s> Because deeper rock is often older , as noted by the principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones . <\s>
<s> Movement along faults can result in folding , either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along , forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault . <\s>
<s> Deeper in the Earth , rocks behave plastically , and fold instead of faulting . <\s>
<s> These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating `` antiforms '' , or where it buckles downwards , creating `` synforms '' . <\s>
<s> If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively . <\s>
<s> If some of the units in the fold are facing downward , the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline , and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown , they are simply called by the most general terms , antiforms and synforms . <\s>
<s> Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner . <\s>
<s> This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning . <\s>
<s> Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower . <\s>
<s> This typically results in younger units being placed below older units . <\s>
<s> Stretching of units can result in their thinning ; in fact , there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter . <\s>
<s> Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed . <\s>
<s> These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , known as boudins , after the French word for `` sausage '' , because of their visual similarity . <\s>
<s> The addition of new rock units , both depositionally and intrusively , often occurs during deformation . <\s>
<s> Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels . <\s>
<s> These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down . <\s>
<s> Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit . <\s>
<s> Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity . <\s>
<s> Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface , and igneous intrusions enter from below . <\s>
<s> Dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed . <\s>
<s> This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms , such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield , or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano . <\s>
<s> All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment , and do not necessarily occur in a single order . <\s>
<s> The Hawaiian Islands , for example , consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows . <\s>
<s> The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time . <\s>
<s> Other areas are much more geologically complex . <\s>
<s> In the southwestern United States , sedimentary , volcanic , and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed , faulted , foliated , and folded . <\s>
<s> Even older rocks , such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada , the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis . <\s>
<s> In addition , these processes can occur in stages . <\s>
<s> In many places , the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example , the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed , and then deformation ended and the upper , undeformed units were deposited . <\s>
<s> Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur , and they can occur any number of times , these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area . <\s>
<s> Geologists use a number of field , laboratory , and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth . <\s>
<s> In typical geological investigations , geologists use primary information related to petrology , stratigraphy , and structural geology . <\s>
<s> In many cases , geologists also study modern soils , rivers , landscapes , and glaciers ; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways , and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface . <\s>
<s> In addition to identifying rocks in the field , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory . <\s>
<s> Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe . <\s>
<s> In an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens . <\s>
<s> In the electron microprobe , individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals . <\s>
<s> Stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units . <\s>
<s> Petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear , and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes . <\s>
<s> This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks . <\s>
<s> This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth , such as subduction and magma chamber evolution . <\s>
<s> Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks . <\s>
<s> They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area . <\s>
<s> In addition , they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings . <\s>
<s> Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges , which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries . <\s>
<s> In the analog versions of these experiments , horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop , which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered orogenic wedge . <\s>
<s> Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt . <\s>
<s> This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range . <\s>
<s> These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure , temperature , space , and time . <\s>
<s> In the laboratory , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores . <\s>
<s> Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface . <\s>
<s> Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions . <\s>
<s> Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the Earth , interpret past environments , and locate areas for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction . <\s>
<s> In the laboratory , biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them . <\s>
<s> These fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed . <\s>
<s> Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition . <\s>
<s> Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores . <\s>
<s> Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate . <\s>
<s> Some modern scholars , such as Fielding H. Garrison , are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end . <\s>
<s> Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni was one of the earliest Persian geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India , hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea . <\s>
<s> Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests , the Persian scholar Ibn Sina proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains , the origin of earthquakes , and other topics central to modern geology , which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science . <\s>
<s> In China , the polymath Shen Kuo formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation : based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean , he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt . <\s>
<s> James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist . <\s>
<s> In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh . <\s>
<s> In his paper , he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land . <\s>
<s> Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 . <\s>
<s> The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure . <\s>
<s> In 1807 , Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States . <\s>
<s> Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him , the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times . <\s>
<s> The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map , and published in the Society 's Transactions , together with the nation 's first geological map . <\s>
<s> This antedates William Smith 's geological map of England by six years , although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks . <\s>
<s> Sir Charles Lyell first published his famous book , Principles of Geology , in 1830 . <\s>
<s> This book , which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin , successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism . <\s>
<s> This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth 's history and are still occurring today . <\s>
<s> In contrast , catastrophism is the theory that Earth 's features formed in single , catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter . <\s>
<s> Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism , the idea was not widely accepted at the time . <\s>
<s> The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries . <\s>
<s> However , the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison . <\s>
<s> In addition to pharma responsibilities , the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners , such as surgery and midwifery . <\s>
<s> The pharma often operated through a retail shop which , in addition to ingredients for medicines , sold tobacco and patent medicines . <\s>
<s> Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term , though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy , in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent . <\s>
<s> The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed . <\s>
<s> The Greek word Pharmakeia derives from pharmakon , meaning `` drug '' , `` medicine '' . <\s>
<s> Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines . <\s>
<s> Pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors , owning the pharmacy in which they practice . <\s>
<s> Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug , and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail , they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual . <\s>
<s> A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians . <\s>
<s> In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research . <\s>
<s> A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council register . <\s>
<s> The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians . <\s>
<s> In Ancient Greece , Diocles of Carystus was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants . <\s>
<s> He wrote several treatises on the topic . <\s>
<s> The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD . <\s>
<s> The Latin translation De Materia Medica was used a basis for many medieval texts , and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age . <\s>
<s> The title coined the term materia medica . <\s>
<s> In Japan , at the end of the Asuka period and the early Nara period , the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected . <\s>
<s> The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taihō Code and re-stated in the Yōrō Code . <\s>
<s> Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established ; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration . <\s>
<s> In this highly stable hierarchy , the pharmacists — and even pharmacist assistants — were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists . <\s>
<s> In the Imperial household , the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor . <\s>
<s> The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology . <\s>
<s> Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi , for instance , acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds . <\s>
<s> Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation . <\s>
<s> His Liber servitoris is of particular interest , as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the ' simples ' from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used . <\s>
<s> Sabur Ibn Sahl , was , however , the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia , describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments . <\s>
<s> Al-Biruni wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology , entitled Kitab al-Saydalah , in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist . <\s>
<s> Avicenna , too , described no less than 700 preparations , their properties , modes of action , and their indications . <\s>
<s> He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine . <\s>
<s> Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo , and Ibn al-Wafid , both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times , appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by ' Mesue ' the younger , and the Medicamentis simplicibus by ' Abenguefit ' . <\s>
<s> Peter of Abano translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris . <\s>
<s> Al-Muwaffaq 's contributions in the field are also pioneering . <\s>
<s> Living in the 10th century , he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies , amongst others describing arsenious oxide , and being acquainted with silicic acid . <\s>
<s> He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate , and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds , especially copper vitriol , and also lead compounds . <\s>
<s> He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking . <\s>
<s> In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik , Croatia , located inside the Franciscan monastery , opened in 1317 ; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn , Estonia , dating from at least 1422 . <\s>
<s> The oldest is claimed to have been set up in 1221 in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence , Italy , which now houses a perfume museum . <\s>
<s> The medieval Esteve Pharmacy , located in Llívia , a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerdà , also now a museum , dates back to the 15th century , keeping albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries , old prescription books and antique drugs . <\s>
<s> In most countries , the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation ; with requirements for storage conditions , compulsory texts , equipment , etc. , specified in legislation . <\s>
<s> Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications , there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients . <\s>
<s> Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients ' prescriptions and patient safety issues . <\s>
<s> Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications , effectiveness of treatment regimens , safety of medications and patient compliance issues many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area . <\s>
<s> Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy . <\s>
<s> For example , there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology , HIV/AIDS , infectious disease , critical care , emergency medicine , toxicology , nuclear pharmacy , pain management , psychiatry , anti-coagulation clinics , herbal medicine , neurology/epilepsy management , pediatrics , neonatal pharmacists and more . <\s>
<s> Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital . <\s>
<s> Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications , including more specialized medications , than would be feasible in the community setting . <\s>
<s> Most hospital medications are unit-dose , or a single dose of medicine . <\s>
<s> Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition , and other medications given intravenously . <\s>
<s> This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel , quality assurance of products , and adequate facilities . <\s>
<s> Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding . <\s>
<s> The high cost of medications and drug-related technology , combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety , make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible . <\s>
<s> Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health , wellness , and disease prevention . <\s>
<s> Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings , but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics . <\s>
<s> Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care . <\s>
<s> Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care . <\s>
<s> They often participate in patient care rounds drug product selection . <\s>
<s> The clinical pharmacist 's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems , identifying goals of therapy , and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient . <\s>
<s> The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy and its efficacy . <\s>
<s> The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions , adverse drug reactions , and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan . <\s>
<s> In the U.S. federal health care system ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority . <\s>
<s> In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority . <\s>
<s> In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification . <\s>
<s> The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP . <\s>
<s> Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review than on actual dispensing of drugs . <\s>
<s> Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes , but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings . <\s>
<s> Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners , though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies . <\s>
<s> This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients , primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings . <\s>
<s> Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services . <\s>
<s> Since about the year 2000 , a growing number of Internet pharmacies have been established worldwide . <\s>
<s> Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies , and in fact , many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door . <\s>
<s> The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received . <\s>
<s> Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take . <\s>
<s> Internet pharmacies are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound . <\s>
<s> While most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription , some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription . <\s>
<s> Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the `` inconvenience '' of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe . <\s>
<s> However , this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous , especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications , risk/benefit ratios , and an individual 's overall suitability for use of a medication . <\s>
<s> There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products . <\s>
<s> Of particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people , youth in particular , can obtain controlled substances via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship . <\s>
<s> There are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription , brokered by an Internet server , for a controlled substance to a `` patient '' s/he has never met . <\s>
<s> In the United States , in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid , it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship . <\s>
<s> The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid . <\s>
<s> Often , individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship . <\s>
<s> In the United States , there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from Canada and other countries , in order to reduce consumer costs . <\s>
<s> While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates Food and Drug Administration regulations and federal laws , enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers , rather than consumers . <\s>
<s> There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription , who has ever been charged by authorities . <\s>
<s> Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science . <\s>
<s> Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy , however , they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies . <\s>
<s> As a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals . <\s>
<s> Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development , deployment and optimization . <\s>
<s> Specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable , oral , infused , or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer , hepatitis , and rheumatoid arthritis . <\s>
<s> Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled , specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored , administered , carefully monitored , and clinically managed . <\s>
<s> In addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs . <\s>
<s> It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs . <\s>
<s> In most jurisdictions , pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians . <\s>
<s> These jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists can not form business partnerships with physicians or give them `` kickback '' payments . <\s>
<s> However , the American Medical Association Code of Ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere . <\s>
<s> 7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own . <\s>
<s> In some rural areas in the United Kingdom , there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices . <\s>
<s> The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified , minimum distance between a patient 's home and the nearest retail pharmacy . <\s>
<s> This law also exists in Austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city . <\s>
<s> The reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers . <\s>
<s> Otherwise , the physician has a financial self-interest in `` diagnosing '' as many conditions as possible , and in exaggerating their seriousness , because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient . <\s>
<s> Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient 's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects . <\s>
<s> This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments . <\s>
<s> In the coming decades , pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system . <\s>
<s> Rather than simply dispensing medication , pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills . <\s>
<s> In particular , Medication Therapy Management includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients . <\s>
<s> Such services include the thorough analysis of all medication currently being taken by an individual . <\s>
<s> The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system . <\s>
<s> This shift has already commenced in some countries ; for instance , pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews . <\s>
<s> In Canada , pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews . <\s>
<s> In the United Kingdom , pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education . <\s>
<s> They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews . <\s>
<s> In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications , for the majority of drugs , except for controlled drugs , when the patient is unable to see their doctor , as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable . <\s>
<s> In the United States , pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the Doctor of Pharmacy degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation . <\s>
<s> In addition , consultant pharmacists , who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients , under the banner of `` senior care pharmacy . '' <\s>
<s> The two symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy in English-speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the ℞ character , which is often written as `` Rx '' in typed text . <\s>
<s> The show globe was also used until the early 20th century . <\s>
<s> Pharmacy organizations often use other symbols , such as the Bowl of Hygieia which is often used in the Netherlands , conical measures , and caduceuses in their logos . <\s>
<s> Other symbols are common in different countries : the green Greek cross in France , Argentina , the United Kingdom , Belgium , Ireland , Italy , Spain , and India , the increasingly rare Gaper in the Netherlands , and a red stylized letter A in Germany and Austria . <\s>
<s> One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution . <\s>
<s> Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws . <\s>
<s> It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India , in Czechoslovakia 's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments , In South Africa in the fight against apartheid , in the American Civil Rights Movement , in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union , recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine , among other various movements worldwide . <\s>
<s> One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles ' play Antigone , in which Antigone , one of the daughters of former King of Thebes , Oedipus , defies Creon , the current King of Thebes , who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial . <\s>
<s> She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law . <\s>
<s> She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with , but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this . <\s>
<s> Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819 , poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year , that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time — and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action . <\s>
<s> It is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest . <\s>
<s> A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience , and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha . <\s>
<s> Gandhi 's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley 's nonviolence in protest and political action . <\s>
<s> In particular , it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley 's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India . <\s>
<s> It has been argued that the term `` civil disobedience '' has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times , become utterly debased . <\s>
<s> Marshall Cohen notes , It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official . <\s>
<s> Indeed , for Vice President Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers , arsonists , draft evaders , campaign hecklers , campus militants , anti-war demonstrators , juvenile delinquents and political assassins . <\s>
<s> LeGrande writes that the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult , if not impossible . <\s>
<s> In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject , the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties . <\s>
<s> Like Alice in Wonderland , he often finds that specific terminology has no more meaning than the individual orator intends it to have . <\s>
<s> He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration , nonviolent civil disobedience , and violent civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen 's relation to the state and its laws , as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies , especially two equally sovereign branches of government , conflict . <\s>
<s> For instance , if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country 's highest court , it would not be civil disobedience , since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen . <\s>
<s> However , this definition is disputed by Thoreau 's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective . <\s>
<s> The individual is the final judge of right and wrong . <\s>
<s> More than this , since only individuals act , only individuals can act unjustly . <\s>
<s> When the government knocks on the door , it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood . <\s>
<s> Before Thoreau 's imprisonment , when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay , Thoreau had advised , `` Resign . '' <\s>
<s> If a man chose to be an agent of injustice , then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice . <\s>
<s> But if government is `` the voice of the people , '' as it is often called , should n't that voice be heeded ? <\s>
<s> Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians . <\s>
<s> Even a good form of government is `` liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it . '' <\s>
<s> Moreover , even if a government did express the voice of the people , this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said . <\s>
<s> The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right . <\s>
<s> What , then , is the proper relationship between the individual and the government ? <\s>
<s> Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities . <\s>
<s> Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions , banks , and private universities can be justified if it reflects `` a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken '' . <\s>
<s> The same principle , she argues , applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments . <\s>
<s> It is usually recognized that lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality , we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking . <\s>
<s> If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights , he might , for instance , find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience . <\s>
<s> This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations . <\s>
<s> The Fully Informed Jury Association 's publication `` A Primer for Prospective Jurors '' notes , `` Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler 's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house . '' <\s>
<s> By this definition , civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus , where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it . <\s>
<s> There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent . <\s>
<s> Black 's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> Christian Bay 's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires `` carefully chosen and legitimate means , '' but holds that they do not have to be non-violent . <\s>
<s> It has been argued that , while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects , rebellion is much more destructive ; therefore , the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience , and if one can not justify civil rebellion , then one can not justify a civil disobedients ' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest . <\s>
<s> Civil disobedients ' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society 's tolerance of civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged `` wrong '' by an individual conscience , or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective , to cause their repeal , or to exert pressure to get one 's political wishes on some other issue . <\s>
<s> Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government . <\s>
<s> Gandhi 's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government . <\s>
<s> Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing `` peaceable revolution . '' <\s>
<s> Howard Zinn , Harvey Wheeler , and others have identified the right espoused in The Declaration of Independence to `` alter or abolish '' an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience <\s>
<s> The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire . <\s>
<s> Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem . <\s>
<s> In modern times , some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met , such as favorable bail conditions , or the release of all the activists . <\s>
<s> This is a form of jail solidarity . <\s>
<s> There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience , such as that committed by Thoreau , but these sometimes go unnoticed . <\s>
<s> Thoreau , at the time of his arrest , was not yet a well-known author , and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days , weeks and months after it happened . <\s>
<s> The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office , and Thoreau 's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War . <\s>
<s> Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts . <\s>
<s> Bedau writes , There is a whole class of acts , undertaken in the name of civil disobedience , which , even if they were widely practiced , would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance .. . <\s>
<s> Such acts are often just a harassment and , at least to the bystander , somewhat inane.. . <\s>
<s> The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity . <\s>
<s> Bedau also notes , though , that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose . <\s>
<s> Some civil disobedients , such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness , which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government , directly achieve a desired social goal while openly breaking the law . <\s>
<s> Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna , a 180-foot -tall , 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days , successfully preventing it from being cut down . <\s>
<s> In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech , civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech . <\s>
<s> An example would be WBAI 's broadcasting the track `` Filthy Words '' from a George Carlin comedy album , which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation . <\s>
<s> Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies . <\s>
<s> For example , Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon , New Hampshire city councilors stating , `` Wise up or die . '' <\s>
<s> Some forms of civil disobedience , such as illegal boycotts , refusals to pay taxes , draft dodging , distributed denial-of-service attacks , and sit-ins , make it more difficult for a system to function . <\s>
<s> In this way , they might be considered coercive . <\s>
<s> Brownlee notes that `` although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue , nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table . '' <\s>
<s> The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes . <\s>
<s> Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases . <\s>
<s> For example , the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property , and whether or not to talk to police officers . <\s>
<s> It is generally agreed within the legal community , and is often believed within the activist community , that a suspect 's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose , and may be harmful . <\s>
<s> However , some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators ' questions , sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications , or due to a fear of seeming rude . <\s>
<s> Also , some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers . <\s>
<s> Thoreau wrote , My civil neighbor , the tax-gatherer , is the very man I have to deal with , for it is , after all , with men and not with parchment that I quarrel , and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government . <\s>
<s> How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government , or as a man , until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me , his neighbor , for whom he has respect , as a neighbor and well-disposed man , or as a maniac and disturber of the peace , and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action . <\s>
<s> Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established , or else suffer the penalties set out in the law . <\s>
<s> Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , or do n't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted . <\s>
<s> And still other civil disobedients , being anarchists , do n't believe in the legitimacy of any government , and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others . <\s>
<s> An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty . <\s>
<s> There is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law . <\s>
<s> It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> ACT-UP 's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating , Yes , I committed the act of which you accuse me . <\s>
<s> I do n't deny it ; in fact , I am proud of it . <\s>
<s> I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law ; I am guilty as charged , but that pleading not guilty sends a message of , Guilt implies wrong-doing . <\s>
<s> I feel I have done no wrong . <\s>
<s> I may have violated some specific laws , but I am guilty of doing no wrong . <\s>
<s> I therefore plead not guilty . <\s>
<s> A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two . <\s>
<s> One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , `` I plead for the beauty that surrounds us '' ; this is known as a `` creative plea , '' and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty . <\s>
<s> When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957 , at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas , Nevada , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest . <\s>
<s> At a pre-arranged announced time , one at a time they stepped across the `` line '' and were immediately arrested . <\s>
<s> They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah , Nevada , and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace , that afternoon . <\s>
<s> A well known civil rights attorney , Francis Heisler , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , advising them to plead `` nolo contendere '' , as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty . <\s>
<s> The arrested persons were found `` guilty , '' nevertheless , and given suspended sentences , conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds . <\s>
<s> Howard Zinn writes , There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice . <\s>
<s> But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it . <\s>
<s> To accept jail penitently as an accession to ' the rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest . <\s>
<s> In particular , the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated . <\s>
<s> Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech , or a speech explaining their actions , in allocution . <\s>
<s> In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar , a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that `` the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy '' . <\s>
<s> As a result , the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days . <\s>
<s> This action was upheld because , according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit , her statement suggested a lack of remorse , an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions , and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions . <\s>
<s> Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials . <\s>
<s> Steven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , `` they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience . '' <\s>
<s> A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage . <\s>
<s> During the Vietnam War era , the Chicago Eight used a political defense , while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense . <\s>
<s> In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes , some civil disobedients seek jury nullification . <\s>
<s> Over the years , this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States , which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative , and United States v. Dougherty , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification . <\s>
<s> One theory is that , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit . <\s>
<s> Therefore , conscientious lawbreakers must be punished . <\s>
<s> Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law , and then wins his case , then that act did not constitute civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience . <\s>
<s> Likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient . <\s>
<s> Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience : `` Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not , itself , the object of protest , whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law . '' <\s>
<s> During the Vietnam War , courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War ; the courts ruled it was a political question . <\s>
<s> The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts , and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom . <\s>
<s> However , court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense . <\s>
<s> Likewise , when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance 's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , and he was found guilty . <\s>
<s> Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to ; according to FIJA , many of them have escaped prosecution because `` prosecutors have reasoned that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters , the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter 's own jury as evidence . '' <\s>
<s> Along with giving the offender his `` just deserts '' , achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment . <\s>
<s> Brownlee argues , `` Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law 's engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law . '' <\s>
<s> Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes , In deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good . <\s>
<s> This means that the objector has no right not to be punished . <\s>
<s> It is a matter for the state to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not . <\s>
<s> Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . <\s>
<s> Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . <\s>
<s> Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . <\s>
<s> Construction starts with planning , design , and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use . <\s>
<s> Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . <\s>
<s> An architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it . <\s>
<s> For the successful execution of a project , effective planning is essential . <\s>
<s> Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements , the environmental impact of the job , the successful scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding , etc . <\s>
<s> The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects . <\s>
<s> In general , there are three sectors of construction : buildings , infrastructure and industrial . <\s>
<s> Building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential . <\s>
<s> Infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering . <\s>
<s> It includes large public works , dams , bridges , highways , water/wastewater and utility distribution . <\s>
<s> Industrial includes refineries , process chemical , power generation , mills and manufacturing plants . <\s>
<s> There are other ways to break the industry into sectors or markets . <\s>
<s> Engineering News-Record is a trade magazine for the construction industry . <\s>
<s> Each year , ENR compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies . <\s>
<s> They publish a list of the largest companies in the United States and also a list the largest global firms . <\s>
<s> In 2014 , ENR compiled the data in nine market segments . <\s>
<s> It was divided as transportation , petroleum , buildings , power , industrial , water , manufacturing , sewer/waste , telecom , hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects . <\s>
<s> In their reporting on the Top 400 , they used data on transportation , sewer , hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors . <\s>
<s> The Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction . <\s>
<s> To recognize the differences of companies in this sector , it is divided into three subsectors : building construction , heavy and civil engineering construction , and specialty trade contractors . <\s>
<s> There are also categories for construction service firms and construction managers . <\s>
<s> Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings . <\s>
<s> The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom . <\s>
<s> Often , the owner of the property acts as laborer , paymaster , and design team for the entire project . <\s>
<s> Although building construction projects typically include various common elements , such as design , financial , estimating and legal considerations , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , such as structural collapse , cost overruns , and/or litigation . <\s>
<s> For this reason , those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome . <\s>
<s> Residential construction practices , technologies , and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice . <\s>
<s> Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used . <\s>
<s> Cost of construction on a per square meter basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions , local regulations , economies of scale and the availability of skilled tradespeople . <\s>
<s> As residential construction can generate a lot of waste , careful planning again is needed here . <\s>
<s> New techniques of building construction are being researched , made possible by advances in 3D printing technology . <\s>
<s> In a form of additive building construction , similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts , building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours , with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities , in one continuous build , using large 3D printers . <\s>
<s> Working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres of building material per hour as of January 2013 , with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres per hour , sufficient to complete a building in a week . <\s>
<s> Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars 's performative architecture 3D-printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014 . <\s>
<s> In the modern industrialized world , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality . <\s>
<s> A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts . <\s>
<s> The design usually consists of drawings and specifications , usually prepared by a design team including Architect , civil engineers , mechanical engineers , electrical engineers , structural engineers , fire protection engineers , planning consultants , architectural consultants , and archaeological consultants . <\s>
<s> The design team is most commonly employed by the property owner . <\s>
<s> Under this system , once the design is completed by the design team , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , either based directly on the design , or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor . <\s>
<s> Following evaluation of bids , the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder . <\s>
<s> The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties , especially among large firms . <\s>
<s> In the past , architects , interior designers , engineers , developers , construction managers , and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies , even in the larger firms . <\s>
<s> Presently , a firm that is nominally an `` architecture '' or `` construction management '' firm may have experts from all related fields as employees , or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill . <\s>
<s> Thus , each such firm may offer itself as `` one-stop shopping '' for a construction project , from beginning to end . <\s>
<s> This is designated as a `` design build '' contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction , while adhering to the performance specifications . <\s>
<s> Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , including design-build , partnering and construction management . <\s>
<s> In general , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , interior designers , engineers and constructors throughout design and construction . <\s>
<s> In response , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process . <\s>
<s> Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems . <\s>
<s> Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project . <\s>
<s> Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials , and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time , can arise even when the overall total is enough . <\s>
<s> Fraud is a problem in many fields , but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field . <\s>
<s> Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project . <\s>
<s> Mortgage bankers , accountants , and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project . <\s>
<s> The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects since the owner 's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project . <\s>
<s> Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process . <\s>
<s> Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation . <\s>
<s> Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs , which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid . <\s>
<s> The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements . <\s>
<s> Constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner . <\s>
<s> Some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations , or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions . <\s>
<s> Other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things that are a matter of custom or expectation , such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district . <\s>
<s> An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built , either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable , or that the custom is no longer needed . <\s>
<s> A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , each of which all parties must carefully consider . <\s>
<s> A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties , but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible . <\s>
<s> The time element in construction means that a delay costs money , and in cases of bottlenecks , the delay can be extremely expensive . <\s>
<s> Thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out . <\s>
<s> Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse . <\s>
<s> There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project . <\s>
<s> New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering aka private finance initiatives and alliances such as `` pure '' or `` project '' alliances and `` impure '' or `` strategic '' alliances . <\s>
<s> The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry . <\s>
<s> This is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized . <\s>
<s> In this arrangement , the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator . <\s>
<s> His or her role is to design the works , prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings , administer the contract , tender the works , and manage the works from inception to completion . <\s>
<s> There are direct contractual links between the architect 's client and the main contractor . <\s>
<s> Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor . <\s>
<s> The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy . <\s>
<s> The owner produces a list of requirements for a project , giving an overall view of the project 's goals . <\s>
<s> Several D & B contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals . <\s>
<s> The owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor . <\s>
<s> Often , it is not just one contractor , but a consortium of several contractors working together . <\s>
<s> Once these have been hired , they begin building the first phase of the project . <\s>
<s> As they build phase 1 , they design phase 2 . <\s>
<s> This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract , where the project is completely designed by the owner , then bid on , then completed . <\s>
<s> Before the foundation can be dug , contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked , either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services . <\s>
<s> This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , water , sewage , phone , and cable facilities , which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations . <\s>
<s> During the construction of a building , the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code . <\s>
<s> Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed , an occupancy permit may be issued . <\s>
<s> In the United States , the industry in 2014 has around $ 960 billion in annual revenue according to statistics tracked by the Census Bureau , of which $ 680 billion is private and the remainder is government . <\s>
<s> As of 2005 , there were about 667,000 firms employing 1 million contractors ; the average contractor employed fewer than 10 employees . <\s>
<s> As a whole , the industry employed an estimated 5.8 million as of April 2013 , with a 13.2 % unemployment rate . <\s>
<s> In the United States , approximately 828,000 women were employed in the construction industry as of 2011 . <\s>
<s> In 2010 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration between different roles , sectors and locations in the construction and built environment industry . <\s>
<s> The results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry , such as the Middle East , yield higher average salaries than in the UK for example . <\s>
<s> The average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the Middle East , across all sectors , job types and levels of experience , is £42,090 , compared to £26,719 in the UK . <\s>
<s> This trend is not necessarily due to the fact that more affluent roles are available , however , as architects with 14 or more years experience working in the Middle East earn on average £43,389 per annum , compared to £40,000 in the UK . <\s>
<s> Some construction workers in the US/Canada have made more than $ 100,000 annually , depending on their trade . <\s>
<s> Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world , incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union . <\s>
<s> In 2009 , the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers . <\s>
<s> Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers . <\s>
<s> Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry . <\s>
<s> Other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution , transportation accidents , and trench cave-ins . <\s>
<s> Private schools , also known as independent schools , non-governmental , or nonstate schools , are not administered by local , state or national governments . <\s>
<s> Thus , they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition , rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , which makes the cost cheaper , depending on a talent the student may have , financial need , or tax credit scholarships that might be available . <\s>
<s> In the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada , the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels ; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions . <\s>
<s> Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity , ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions . <\s>
<s> Annual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called ' tuition-free ' schools to more than $ 45,000 at several New England preparatory schools . <\s>
<s> The secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 and year 13 . <\s>
<s> This category includes university-preparatory schools or `` prep schools '' , boarding schools and day schools . <\s>
<s> Tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors , including the location of the school , the willingness of parents to pay , peer tuitions and the school 's financial endowment . <\s>
<s> High tuition , schools claim , is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments , including a low student to teacher ratio , small class sizes and services , such as libraries , science laboratories and computers . <\s>
<s> Some private schools are boarding schools and many military academies are privately owned or operated as well . <\s>
<s> Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools . <\s>
<s> Some such schools teach religious education , together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith 's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend . <\s>
<s> Others use the denomination as more of a general label to describe on what the founders based their belief , while still maintaining a fine distinction between academics and religion . <\s>
<s> They include parochial schools , a term which is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools . <\s>
<s> Other religious groups represented in the K-12 private education sector include Protestants , Jews , Muslims and the Orthodox Christians . <\s>
<s> Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons : prestige and the social status of the ' old school tie ' ; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities , higher-paid teachers ; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education . <\s>
<s> Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education ; the presence of boarding facilities ; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion , a tool not readily available to government schools . <\s>
<s> Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example , a compulsory blazer . <\s>
<s> Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts . <\s>
<s> Although most are non-aligned , some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large , long-established religious foundations , such as the Anglican Church , Uniting Church and Presbyterian Church , but in most cases , they do not insist on their students ' religious allegiance . <\s>
<s> These schools are typically viewed as ' elite schools ' . <\s>
<s> Many of the ' grammar schools ' also fall in this category . <\s>
<s> They are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style , some Catholic schools fall into this category as well , e.g. St Joseph 's College , Gregory Terrace , Saint Ignatius ' College , Riverview , St Gregory 's College , Campbelltown , St Aloysius ' College and St Joseph 's College , Hunters Hill , as well as Loreto Kirribilli , Monte Sant Angelo Mercy College , St Ursula 's College and Loreto Normanhurst for girls . <\s>
<s> The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7 , Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and can not be suspended even in a state of emergency . <\s>
<s> It is also not possible to abolish these rights . <\s>
<s> This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future . <\s>
<s> Still , they are less common than in many other countries . <\s>
<s> Overall , between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1 % to 7.8 % . <\s>
<s> Percent of students in private high schools reached 11.1 % . <\s>
<s> Ersatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or religious groups . <\s>
<s> These schools offer the same types of diplomas as public schools . <\s>
<s> Ersatzschulen lack the freedom to operate completely outside of government regulation . <\s>
<s> Teachers at Ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools , an Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and Article 7 , Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz , also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents . <\s>
<s> Therefore , most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships , compared to most other Western European countries . <\s>
<s> However , it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees , which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds . <\s>
<s> The percentages of public money could reach 100 % of the personnel expenditures . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , Private Schools became insolvent in the past in Germany . <\s>
<s> Ergänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or rarely , religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools . <\s>
<s> Most of these schools are vocational schools . <\s>
<s> However , these vocational schools are not part of the German dual education system . <\s>
<s> Ergänzungsschulen have the freedom to operate outside of government regulation and are funded in whole by charging their students tuition fees . <\s>
<s> In India , private schools are called independent schools , but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government , it can be an aided or an unaided school . <\s>
<s> So , in a strict sense , a private school is an unaided independent school . <\s>
<s> For the purpose of this definition , only receipt of financial aid is considered , not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate . <\s>
<s> It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution . <\s>
<s> The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector . <\s>
<s> Among other things , this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates . <\s>
<s> Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE , NENBSE <\s>
<s> Legally , only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in India . <\s>
<s> They will have to satisfy a number of infrastructure and human resource related criteria to get Recognition from the government . <\s>
<s> Critics of this system point out that this leads to corruption by school inspectors who check compliance and to fewer schools in a country that has the largest adult illiterate population in the world . <\s>
<s> While official data does not capture the real extent of private schooling in the country , various studies have reported unpopularity of government schools and an increasing number of private schools . <\s>
<s> The Annual Status of Education Report , which evaluates learning levels in rural India , has been reporting poorer academic achievement in government schools than in private schools . <\s>
<s> A key difference between the government and private schools is that the medium of education in private schools is English while it is the local language in government schools . <\s>
<s> In Ireland , private schools are unusual because a certain number of teacher 's salaries are paid by the State . <\s>
<s> If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees , which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world . <\s>
<s> There is , however , a limited element of state assessment of private schools , because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education ; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate , for example . <\s>
<s> Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools . <\s>
<s> The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools , but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year . <\s>
<s> The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order , i.e. , the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers , etc . <\s>
<s> After Malaysia 's independence in 1957 , the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system . <\s>
<s> This caused an uproar among the Chinese and a compromise was achieved in that the schools would instead become `` National Type '' schools . <\s>
<s> Under such a system , the government is only in charge of the school curriculum and teaching personnel while the lands still belonged to the schools . <\s>
<s> While Chinese primary schools were allowed to retain Chinese as the medium of instruction , Chinese secondary schools are required to change into English-medium schools . <\s>
<s> Over 60 schools converted to become National Type schools . <\s>
<s> The other category of schools are those run and partly or fully funded by private individuals , private organizations and religious groups . <\s>
<s> The ones that accept government funds are called ' aided ' schools . <\s>
<s> The private ' un-aided ' schools are fully funded by private parties . <\s>
<s> The standard and the quality of education is quite high . <\s>
<s> Technically , these would be categorized as private schools , but many of them have the name `` Public School '' appended to them , e.g. , the Galaxy Public School in Kathmandu . <\s>
<s> Most of the middle-class families send their children to such schools , which might be in their own city or far off , like boarding schools . <\s>
<s> The medium of education is English , but as a compulsory subject , Nepali and/or the state 's official language is also taught . <\s>
<s> Preschool education is mostly limited to organized neighbourhood nursery schools . <\s>
<s> As of April 2014 , there are 88 private schools in New Zealand , catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7 % of the entire student population . <\s>
<s> Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools , mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy . <\s>
<s> State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school , e.g. they must teach the state curriculum , they must employ registered teachers , and they ca n't charge tuition fees . <\s>
<s> The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984 , when the nation 's then-private Catholic school system integrated . <\s>
<s> As a result , private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities and niche markets . <\s>
<s> Private schools are often Anglican , such as King 's College and Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland , St Paul 's Collegiate School in Hamilton , St Peter 's School in Cambridge , Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington , and Christ 's College and St Margaret 's College in Christchurch ; or Presbyterian , such as Saint Kentigern College and St Cuthbert 's College in Auckland , Scots College and Queen Margaret College in Wellington , and St Andrew 's College and Rangi Ruru Girls ' School in Christchurch . <\s>
<s> Academic Colleges Group is a recent group of private schools run as a business , with schools throughout Auckland , including ACG Senior College in Auckland 's CBD , ACG Parnell College in Parnell , and international school ACG New Zealand International College . <\s>
<s> There are three private schools operated by the Catholic schismatic group , the Society of St Pius X in Wanganui . <\s>
<s> In the Philippines , the private sector has been a major provider of educational services , accounting for about 7.5 % of primary enrollment , 32 % of secondary enrollment and about 80 % of tertiary enrollment . <\s>
<s> Private schools have proven to be efficient in resource utilization . <\s>
<s> Per unit costs in private schools are generally lower when compared to public schools . <\s>
<s> This situation is more evident at the tertiary level . <\s>
<s> Government regulations have given private education more flexibility and autonomy in recent years , notably by lifting the moratorium on applications for new courses , new schools and conversions , by liberalizing tuition fee policy for private schools , by replacing values education for third and fourth years with English , mathematics and natural science at the option of the school , and by issuing the revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools in August 1992 . <\s>
<s> The Education Service Contracting scheme of the government provides financial assistance for tuition and other school fees of students turned away from public high schools because of enrollment overflows . <\s>
<s> The Tuition Fee Supplement is geared to students enrolled in priority courses in post-secondary and non-degree programmes , including vocational and technical courses . <\s>
<s> The Private Education Student Financial Assistance is made available to underprivileged , but deserving high school graduates , who wish to pursue college/technical education in private colleges and universities . <\s>
<s> Some of the oldest schools in South Africa are private church schools that were established by missionaries in the early nineteenth century . <\s>
<s> The private sector has grown ever since . <\s>
<s> After the abolition of apartheid , the laws governing private education in South Africa changed significantly . <\s>
<s> The South African Schools Act of 1996 recognises two categories of schools : `` public '' and `` independent '' . <\s>
<s> In the final years of the apartheid era , parents at white government schools were given the option to convert to a `` semi-private '' form called Model C , and many of these schools changed their admissions policies to accept children of other races . <\s>
<s> Following the transition to democracy , the legal form of `` Model C '' was abolished , however , the term continues to be used to describe government schools formerly reserved for white children. . <\s>
<s> These schools tend to produce better academic results than government schools formerly reserved for other race groups . <\s>
<s> Former `` Model C '' schools are not private schools , as they are state-controlled . <\s>
<s> All schools in South Africa have the right to set compulsory school fees , and formerly model C schools tend to set much higher school fees than other public schools . <\s>
<s> In Sweden , pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools . <\s>
<s> Over 10 % of Swedish pupils were enrolled in private schools in 2008 . <\s>
<s> Sweden is internationally known for this innovative school voucher model that provides Swedish pupils with the opportunity to choose the school they prefer . <\s>
<s> For instance , the biggest school chain , Kunskapsskolan , offers 30 schools and a web-based environment , has 700 employees and teaches nearly 10,000 pupils . <\s>
<s> The Swedish system has been recommended to Barack Obama . <\s>
<s> Private schools generally prefer to be called independent schools , because of their freedom to operate outside of government and local government control . <\s>
<s> Some of these are also known as public schools . <\s>
<s> Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools . <\s>
<s> The name `` public school '' is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere , and not merely to those from a certain locality , and of any religion or occupation . <\s>
<s> According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level . <\s>
<s> Many independent schools are single-sex . <\s>
<s> Fees range from under £3,000 to £21,000 and above per year for day pupils , rising to £27,000+ per year for boarders . <\s>
<s> For details in Scotland , see `` Meeting the Cost '' . <\s>
<s> In many parts of the United States , after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that demanded United States schools desegregate `` with all deliberate speed '' , local families organized a wave of private `` Christian academies '' . <\s>
<s> In much of the U.S. South , many white students migrated to the academies , while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students . <\s>
<s> The academic content of the academies was usually College Preparatory . <\s>
<s> Since the 1970s , many of these `` segregation academies '' have shut down , although some continue to operate . <\s>
<s> Funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition , endowments , scholarship/voucher funds , and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals . <\s>
<s> Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden , according to the courts ' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments . <\s>
<s> Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle , preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status . <\s>
<s> Private schooling in the United States has been debated by educators , lawmakers and parents , since the beginnings of compulsory education in Massachusetts in 1852 . <\s>
<s> The Supreme Court precedent appears to favor educational choice , so long as states may set standards for educational accomplishment . <\s>
<s> Some of the most relevant Supreme Court case law on this is as follows : Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U.S. 160 ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ; Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 ; Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 . <\s>
<s> As of 2012 , quality private schools in the United States charged substantial tuition , close to $ 40,000 annually for day schools in New York City , and nearly $ 50,000 for boarding schools . <\s>
<s> However , tuition did not cover operating expenses , particularly at boarding schools . <\s>
<s> The leading schools such as the Groton School had substantial endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising drives . <\s>
<s> Boarding schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the country , indeed the globe , and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity . <\s>
<s> Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning , and the Harvard Corporation is its first chartered corporation . <\s>
<s> Although never formally affiliated with any denomination , the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy . <\s>
<s> Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . <\s>
<s> Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . <\s>
<s> James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war . <\s>
<s> The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College . <\s>
<s> Harvard is a large , highly residential research university . <\s>
<s> The nominal cost of attendance is high , but the University 's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages . <\s>
<s> It operates several arts , cultural , and scientific museums , alongside the Harvard Library , which is the world 's largest academic and private library system , comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's alumni include eight U.S. presidents , several foreign heads of state , 62 living billionaires , 335 Rhodes Scholars , and 242 Marshall Scholars . <\s>
<s> To date , some 150 Nobel laureates , 18 Fields Medalists and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students , faculty , or staff . <\s>
<s> The University is organized into eleven separate academic units — ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study — with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area : its 209-acre main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 miles northwest of Boston ; the business school and athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's $ 37.6 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution . <\s>
<s> Harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony . <\s>
<s> It was initially called `` New College '' or `` the college at New Towne '' . <\s>
<s> In 1638 , the college became home for North America 's first known printing press , carried by the ship John of London . <\s>
<s> In 1639 , the college was renamed Harvard College after deceased clergyman John Harvard , who was an alumnus of the University of Cambridge . <\s>
<s> He had left the school £779 and his library of some 400 books . <\s>
<s> The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650 . <\s>
<s> In the early years the College trained many Puritan ministers . <\s>
<s> A 1643 publication said the school 's purpose was `` to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity , dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust '' . <\s>
<s> It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model — ​​many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge — ​​but conformed Puritanism . <\s>
<s> It was never affiliated with any particular denomination , but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches . <\s>
<s> Throughout the 18th century , Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers , putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist , Calvinist parties . <\s>
<s> When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later , in 1804 , a struggle broke out over their replacements . <\s>
<s> Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805 , and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later , which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal , Arminian ideas . <\s>
<s> In 1846 , the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College . <\s>
<s> Agassiz 's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans ' `` participation in the Divine Nature '' and the possibility of understanding `` intellectual existences '' . <\s>
<s> Agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the `` divine plan '' in all phenomena . <\s>
<s> When it came to explaining life-forms , Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence . <\s>
<s> This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart , whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time . <\s>
<s> The popularity of Agassiz 's efforts to `` soar with Plato '' probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed , including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth , John Norrisand , in a Romantic vein , Samuel Coleridge . <\s>
<s> The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the `` official philosophy '' of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school . <\s>
<s> Charles W. Eliot , president 1869–1909 , eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction . <\s>
<s> While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education , he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education , but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions . <\s>
<s> Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature , the right and ability of each person to perceive truth , and the indwelling God in each person . <\s>
<s> James Bryant Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions . <\s>
<s> He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy , so Conant devised programs to identify , recruit , and support talented youth . <\s>
<s> In 1943 , he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be , at the secondary as well as the college level . <\s>
<s> The resulting Report , published in 1945 , was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century . <\s>
<s> Women remained segregated at Radcliffe , though more and more took Harvard classes . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless , Harvard 's undergraduate population remained predominantly male , with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe . <\s>
<s> Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977 , the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased , mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's graduate schools , which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college , also became more diverse in the post-World War II period . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's 209-acre main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , about 3 miles west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston , and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood . <\s>
<s> Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university , academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall , Memorial Church , and the majority of the freshman dormitories . <\s>
<s> Sophomore , junior , and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses , nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River . <\s>
<s> The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle , which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard . <\s>
<s> Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates , House masters , and resident tutors , as well as a dining hall and library . <\s>
<s> The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness . <\s>
<s> The Harvard Business School and many of the university 's athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located on a 358-acre campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston . <\s>
<s> The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses . <\s>
<s> The Harvard Medical School , Harvard School of Dental Medicine , and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles south of the Cambridge campus . <\s>
<s> Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Allston , a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge , with the intent of major expansion southward . <\s>
<s> The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge . <\s>
<s> Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges , a shuttle service and/or a tram . <\s>
<s> Plans also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River , as well as the construction of bike paths , and buildings throughout the Allston campus . <\s>
<s> The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school , but surrounding community , pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure , possible shuttles open to the public , and park space which will also be publicly accessible . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's 2,400 professors , lecturers , and instructors instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students . <\s>
<s> The school color is crimson , which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper , The Harvard Crimson . <\s>
<s> The color was unofficially adopted by an 1875 vote of the student body , although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858 , when Charles William Eliot , a young graduate student who would later become Harvard 's 21st and longest-serving president , bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta . <\s>
<s> Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world . <\s>
<s> As of September 2011 , it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession . <\s>
<s> It was worth $ 32 billion in 2011 , up from $ 28 billion in September 2010 and $ 26 billion in 2009 . <\s>
<s> It suffered about 30 % loss in 2008-09 . <\s>
<s> In December 2008 , Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22 % from July to October 2008 , necessitating budget cuts . <\s>
<s> Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure , a reduction of nearly 50 % of its endowment in the first four months alone . <\s>
<s> Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $ 12 billion . <\s>
<s> One of the most visible results of Harvard 's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $ 1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011 , resulting in protests from local residents . <\s>
<s> As of 2012 , Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $ 159 million for students , and a Pell Grant reserve of $ 4.093 million available for disbursement . <\s>
<s> During the divestment from South Africa movement in the late 1980s , student activists erected a symbolic `` shantytown '' on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech given by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown . <\s>
<s> The Harvard Management Company repeatedly refused to divest , stating that `` operating expenses must not be subject to financially unrealistic strictures or carping by the unsophisticated or by special interest groups . '' <\s>
<s> However , the university did eventually reduce its South African holdings by $ 230 million in response to the pressure . <\s>
<s> Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as `` more selective , lower transfer-in '' . <\s>
<s> Harvard College accepted 5.3 % of applicants for the class of 2019 , a record low and the second lowest acceptance rate among all national universities . <\s>
<s> Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities , yet for the class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced . <\s>
<s> The four-year , full-time undergraduate program comprises a minority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction with an `` arts and sciences focus '' . <\s>
<s> Between 1978 and 2008 , entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration . <\s>
<s> Since 2008 , undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories : Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding , Culture and Belief , Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning , Ethical Reasoning , Science of Living Systems , Science of the Physical Universe , Societies of the World , and United States in the World . <\s>
<s> Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate degrees . <\s>
<s> The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , The New York Times , and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education ; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May . <\s>
<s> Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time . <\s>
<s> In many concentrations , students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work . <\s>
<s> Students graduating in the top 4–5 % of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude , students in the next 15 % of the class are awarded magna cum laude , and the next 30 % of the class are awarded cum laude . <\s>
<s> Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually . <\s>
<s> Harvard , along with other universities , has been accused of grade inflation , although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased . <\s>
<s> Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90 % in 2004 to 60 % in 2005 . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the honors of `` John Harvard Scholar '' and `` Harvard College Scholar '' will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class . <\s>
<s> For the 2012–13 school year annual tuition was $ 38,000 , with a total cost of attendance of $ 57,000 . <\s>
<s> Beginning 2007 , families with incomes below $ 60,000 pay nothing for their children to attend , including room and board . <\s>
<s> Families with incomes between $ 60,000 to $ 80,000 pay only a few thousand dollars per year , and families earning between $ 120,000 and $ 180,000 pay no more than 10 % of their annual incomes . <\s>
<s> In 2009 , Harvard offered grants totaling $ 414 million across all eleven divisions ; $ 340 million came from institutional funds , $ 35 million from federal support , and $ 39 million from other outside support . <\s>
<s> Grants total 88 % of Harvard 's aid for undergraduate students , with aid also provided by loans and work-study . <\s>
<s> The Harvard University Library System is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding over 18 million volumes . <\s>
<s> According to the American Library Association , this makes it the largest academic library in the United States , and one of the largest in the world . <\s>
<s> Cabot Science Library , Lamont Library , and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use , with easy access and central locations . <\s>
<s> There are rare books , manuscripts and other special collections throughout Harvard 's libraries ; Houghton Library , the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America , and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials . <\s>
<s> America 's oldest collection of maps , gazetteers , and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public . <\s>
<s> The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library . <\s>
<s> Harvard operates several arts , cultural , and scientific museums . <\s>
<s> The Harvard Art Museums comprises three museums . <\s>
<s> The Arthur M. Sackler Museum includes collections of ancient , Asian , Islamic and later Indian art , the Busch-Reisinger Museum , formerly the Germanic Museum , covers central and northern European art , and the Fogg Museum of Art , covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance , British pre-Raphaelite , and 19th-century French art . <\s>
<s> The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum , Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit , and the Museum of Comparative Zoology . <\s>
<s> Other museums include the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts , designed by Le Corbusier , housing the film archive , the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology , specializing in the cultural history and civilizations of the Western Hemisphere , and the Semitic Museum featuring artifacts from excavations in the Middle East . <\s>
<s> Harvard has been highly ranked by many university rankings . <\s>
<s> In particular , it has consistently topped the Academic Ranking of World Universities since 2003 , and the THE World Reputation Rankings since 2011 , when the first time such league tables were published . <\s>
<s> When the QS and Times were published in partnership as the THE-QS World University Rankings during 2004-2009 , Harvard had also been regarded the first in every year . <\s>
<s> The University 's undergraduate program has been continuously among the top two in the U.S. News & World Report . <\s>
<s> In 2014 , Harvard topped the University Ranking by Academic Performance . <\s>
<s> It was ranked 8th on the 2013-2014 PayScale College Salary Report and 14th on the 2013 PayScale College Education Value Rankings . <\s>
<s> From a poll done by The Princeton Review , Harvard is the second most commonly named `` dream college '' , both for students and parents in 2013 , and was the first nominated by parents in 2009 . <\s>
<s> In 2011 , the Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities ranked Harvard 1st university in the world in terms of number of alumni holding CEO position in Fortune Global 500 companies . <\s>
<s> The Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League . <\s>
<s> Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game , although the Harvard–Yale Regatta predates the football game . <\s>
<s> This rivalry , though , is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team , a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world . <\s>
<s> Harvard 's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet , coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting , which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply `` The Game '' . <\s>
<s> While Harvard 's football team is no longer one of the country 's best as it often was a century ago during football 's early days , both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played . <\s>
<s> In 1903 , Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country . <\s>
<s> The stadium 's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game . <\s>
<s> Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport , Walter Camp , suggested widening the field to open up the game . <\s>
<s> But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface . <\s>
<s> So , other steps had to be taken . <\s>
<s> Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season . <\s>
<s> These included legalizing the forward pass , perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport 's history . <\s>
<s> Harvard has several athletic facilities , such as the Lavietes Pavilion , a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams . <\s>
<s> The Malkin Athletic Center , known as the `` MAC '' , serves both as the university 's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports . <\s>
<s> The five-story building includes two cardio rooms , an Olympic-size swimming pool , a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities , a mezzanine , where all types of classes are held , an indoor cycling studio , three weight rooms , and a three-court gym floor to play basketball . <\s>
<s> The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes . <\s>
<s> It is home to Harvard volleyball , fencing and wrestling . <\s>
<s> The offices of several of the school 's varsity coaches are also in the MAC . <\s>
<s> Older than The Game by 23 years , the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools . <\s>
<s> It is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut . <\s>
<s> The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing . <\s>
<s> Today , Harvard fields top teams in several other sports , such as the Harvard Crimson men 's ice hockey team , squash , and even recently won NCAA titles in Men 's and Women 's Fencing . <\s>
<s> Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003 . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Florida , and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States . <\s>
<s> It is the county seat of Duval County , with which the city government consolidated in 1968 . <\s>
<s> Consolidation gave Jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits ; with an estimated population of 853,382 in 2014 , it is the most populous city proper in Florida and the Southeast , and the 12th most populous in the United States . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville is the principal city in the Jacksonville metropolitan area , with a population of 1,345,596 in 2010 . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville is in the First Coast region of northeast Florida and is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River , about 25 miles south of the Georgia state line and about 340 miles north of Miami . <\s>
<s> The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast . <\s>
<s> The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people , and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline , one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States . <\s>
<s> Under British rule , settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed , known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British . <\s>
<s> A platted town was established there in 1822 , a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain ; it was named after Andrew Jackson , the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States . <\s>
<s> Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port . <\s>
<s> Its riverine location facilitates two United States Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville , Florida 's third largest seaport . <\s>
<s> The two US Navy bases , Blount Island Command and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States . <\s>
<s> Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking , insurance , healthcare and logistics . <\s>
<s> As with much of Florida , tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area , particularly tourism related to golf . <\s>
<s> People from Jacksonville may be called `` Jacksonvillians '' or `` Jaxsons '' . <\s>
<s> The area of the modern city of Jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years . <\s>
<s> On Black Hammock Island in the national Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve , a University of North Florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the United States , dating to 2500 BC . <\s>
<s> In the 16th century , the beginning of the historical era , the region was inhabited by the Mocama , a coastal subgroup of the Timucua people . <\s>
<s> At the time of contact with Europeans , all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa , centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River . <\s>
<s> One early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville ; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area . <\s>
<s> French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River in 1562 calling it the River of May because he discovered it in May . <\s>
<s> Ribault erected a stone column near present-day Jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for France . <\s>
<s> In 1564 , René Goulaine de Laudonnière established the first European settlement , Fort Caroline , on the St. Johns near the main village of the Saturiwa . <\s>
<s> Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Menéndez de Avilés to protect the interest of Spain by attacking the French presence at Fort Caroline . <\s>
<s> On September 20 , 1565 , a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline , and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it . <\s>
<s> The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo , and following the ejection of the French , St. Augustine 's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified . <\s>
<s> The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964 . <\s>
<s> Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War , and the British soon constructed the King 's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia . <\s>
<s> The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point , which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford ; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there . <\s>
<s> The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane , indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber . <\s>
<s> As a result , the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish . <\s>
<s> Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783 , after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War , and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow . <\s>
<s> After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821 , American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town , laying out the streets and plats . <\s>
<s> They soon named the town Jacksonville , after Andrew Jackson . <\s>
<s> Led by Isaiah D. Hart , residents wrote a charter for a town government , which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9 , 1832 . <\s>
<s> During the American Civil War , Jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from Florida to aid the Confederate cause . <\s>
<s> The city was blockaded by Union forces , who gained control of the nearby Fort Clinch . <\s>
<s> Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville proper , the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces . <\s>
<s> The Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862 just outside Jacksonville proper resulted in the first Confederate victory in Florida . <\s>
<s> In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee resulting in a Confederate victory . <\s>
<s> Union forces then retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war . <\s>
<s> In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek . <\s>
<s> Warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war . <\s>
<s> During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age , Jacksonville and nearby St . <\s>
<s> Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous . <\s>
<s> Visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad . <\s>
<s> President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22 , 1888 during his trip to Florida . <\s>
<s> This highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism . <\s>
<s> The city 's tourism , however , was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks . <\s>
<s> In addition , extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south drew visitors to other areas . <\s>
<s> From 1893 to 1938 Jacksonville was the site of the Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home with a nearby cemetery . <\s>
<s> On May 3 , 1901 , downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire . <\s>
<s> Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabling the fire to spread rapidly . <\s>
<s> In just eight hours , it swept through 146 city blocks , destroyed over 2,000 buildings , left about 10,000 homeless and killed 7 residents . <\s>
<s> The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire . <\s>
<s> Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order . <\s>
<s> On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville . <\s>
<s> It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah , Georgia , and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh , North Carolina . <\s>
<s> Known as the `` Great Fire of 1901 '' , it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States . <\s>
<s> Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city . <\s>
<s> The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902 . <\s>
<s> The St. James Building , built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down , was built in 1912 as Klutho 's crowning achievement . <\s>
<s> In the 1910s , New York–based filmmakers were attracted to Jacksonville 's warm climate , exotic locations , excellent rail access , and cheap labor . <\s>
<s> Over the course of the decade , more than 30 silent film studios were established , earning Jacksonville the title of `` Winter Film Capital of the World '' . <\s>
<s> However , the emergence of Hollywood as a major film production center ended the city 's film industry . <\s>
<s> One converted movie studio site , Norman Studios , remains in Arlington ; It has been converted to the Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville , like most large cities in the United States , suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II . <\s>
<s> The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs . <\s>
<s> After World War II , the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war . <\s>
<s> Mayor W. Haydon Burns ' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall , civic auditorium , public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride . <\s>
<s> However , the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class `` white flight '' left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before . <\s>
<s> The city 's most populous ethnic group , non-Hispanic white , declined from 75.8 % in 1970 to 55.1 % by 2010 . <\s>
<s> Much of the city 's tax base dissipated , leading to problems with funding education , sanitation , and traffic control within the city limits . <\s>
<s> In addition , residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services , such as sewage and building code enforcement . <\s>
<s> In 1958 , a study recommended that the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county . <\s>
<s> Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965 . <\s>
<s> When a consolidation referendum was held in 1967 , voters approved the plan . <\s>
<s> On October 1 , 1968 , the governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville . <\s>
<s> Fire , police , health & welfare , recreation , public works , and housing & urban development were all combined under the new government . <\s>
<s> In honor of the occasion , then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the `` Bold New City of the South '' at Florida 13 and Julington Creek . <\s>
<s> The Better Jacksonville Plan , promoted as a blueprint for Jacksonville 's future and approved by Jacksonville voters in 2000 , authorized a half-penny sales tax . <\s>
<s> This would generate most of the revenue required for the $ 2.25 billion package of major projects that included road & infrastructure improvements , environmental preservation , targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities . <\s>
<s> According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 874.3 square miles , making Jacksonville the largest city in land area in the contiguous United States ; of this , 86.66 % is land and ; 13.34 % is water . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville surrounds the town of Baldwin . <\s>
<s> Nassau County lies to the north , Baker County lies to the west , and Clay and St. Johns County lie to the south ; the Atlantic Ocean lies to the east , along with the Jacksonville Beaches . <\s>
<s> The St. Johns River divides the city . <\s>
<s> The Trout River , a major tributary of the St. Johns River , is located entirely within Jacksonville . <\s>
<s> The tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville 's skyline is the Bank of America Tower , constructed in 1990 as the Barnett Center . <\s>
<s> It has a height of 617 ft and includes 42 floors . <\s>
<s> Other notable structures include the 37-story Wells Fargo Center , originally built in 1972-74 by the Independent Life and Accident Insurance Company , and the 28 floor Riverplace Tower which , when completed in 1967 , was the tallest precast , post-tensioned concrete structure in the world . <\s>
<s> Like much of the south Atlantic region of the United States , Jacksonville has a humid subtropical climate , with mild weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers . <\s>
<s> Seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from May through September , while the driest months are from November through April . <\s>
<s> Due to Jacksonville 's low latitude and coastal location , the city sees very little cold weather , and winters are typically mild and sunny . <\s>
<s> Summers can be hot and wet , and summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are common . <\s>
<s> Mean monthly temperatures range from around 53 F in January to 82 F in July . <\s>
<s> High temperatures average 64 to 92 °F throughout the year . <\s>
<s> High heat indices are common for the summer months in the area , with indices above 110 °F possible . <\s>
<s> The highest temperature recorded was 104 °F on July 11 , 1879 and July 28 , 1872 . <\s>
<s> It is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon . <\s>
<s> These are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water , combined with extremely high humidity . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities , although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane . <\s>
<s> The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871 ; however , Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean , or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area . <\s>
<s> The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964 , the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds . <\s>
<s> The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph , making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008 's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state , bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days . <\s>
<s> Similarly , four years prior to this , Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne , which made landfall south of the area . <\s>
<s> These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville . <\s>
<s> Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach . <\s>
<s> During Floyd , the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged , and later demolished . <\s>
<s> The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay , but not destroyed . <\s>
<s> Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004 , spawning a minor tornado in the process . <\s>
<s> On May 28 , 2012 , Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl , packing winds up to 70 miles per hour which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida , and the twelfth most populous city in the United States . <\s>
<s> As of 2010 , there were 821,784 people and 366,273 households in the city . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville has the country 's tenth-largest Arab population , with a total population of 5,751 according to the 2000 United States Census . <\s>
<s> Jacksonville has Florida 's largest Filipino American community , with 25,033 in the metropolitan area as of the 2010 Census . <\s>
<s> Much of Jacksonville 's Filipino community served in or has ties to the United States Navy . <\s>
<s> As of 2010 , there were 366,273 households out of which 11.8 % were vacant . <\s>
<s> 23.9 % of households had children under the age of 18 living with them , 43.8 % were married couples , 15.2 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 36.4 % were non-families . <\s>
<s> 29.7 % of all households were made up of individuals and 7.9 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . <\s>
<s> The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.21 . <\s>
<s> In the city , the population was spread out with 23.9 % under the age of 18 , 10.5 % from 18 to 24 , 28.5 % from 25 to 44 , 26.2 % from 45 to 64 , and 10.9 % who were 65 years of age or older . <\s>
<s> The median age was 35.5 years . <\s>
<s> For every 100 females there were 94.1 males . <\s>
<s> For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 91.3 males . <\s>
<s> According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans `` have more wealth than half of all Americans combined . '' <\s>
<s> According to the New York Times on July 22 , 2014 , the `` richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent '' . <\s>
<s> Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a `` substantial head start '' . <\s>
<s> In September 2012 , according to the Institute for Policy Studies , `` over 60 percent '' of the Forbes richest 400 Americans `` grew up in substantial privilege '' . <\s>
<s> Neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor , capital and land . <\s>
<s> Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers . <\s>
<s> In this perspective , wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor . <\s>
<s> Thus , in a market economy , inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions . <\s>
<s> In Marxian analysis , capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits . <\s>
<s> Over the long-term , this trend increases the organic composition of capital , meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs , increasing unemployment . <\s>
<s> This process exerts a downward pressure on wages . <\s>
<s> The substitution of capital equipment for labor raises the productivity of each worker , resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class . <\s>
<s> In a purely capitalist mode of production the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market . <\s>
<s> Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good . <\s>
<s> Thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill . <\s>
<s> And therefore , inequality is driven by this price . <\s>
<s> Under the law of supply and demand , the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker . <\s>
<s> `` On the other hand , markets can also concentrate wealth , pass environmental costs on to society , and abuse workers and consumers . '' <\s>
<s> `` Markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair . '' <\s>
<s> Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed . <\s>
<s> Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor . <\s>
<s> For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest , it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers . <\s>
<s> A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time competing for a job that few require will result in a low wage for that job . <\s>
<s> This is because competition between workers drives down the wage . <\s>
<s> An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service . <\s>
<s> Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job . <\s>
<s> A job where there are few able or willing workers , but a large need for the positions , will result in high wages for that job . <\s>
<s> This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage . <\s>
<s> Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills , rare abilities , or a high level of risk . <\s>
<s> Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job , since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position . <\s>
<s> Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members . <\s>
<s> Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining , political influence , or corruption . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level . <\s>
<s> However , most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity . <\s>
<s> Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter , whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products , services , or underserved market needs . <\s>
<s> The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth . <\s>
<s> Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system . <\s>
<s> A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases . <\s>
<s> In a progressive tax system , the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society , either increasing it or decreasing it , provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime . <\s>
<s> Additionally , steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board . <\s>
<s> The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation . <\s>
<s> An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals ' access to education . <\s>
<s> Education , especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers , creates high wages for those with this education , however , increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality . <\s>
<s> As a result , those who are unable to afford an education , or choose not to pursue optional education , generally receive much lower wages . <\s>
<s> The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment . <\s>
<s> Conversely , education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor . <\s>
<s> In 2014 , economists with the Standard & Poor 's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S. 's wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles . <\s>
<s> To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth , S & P recommended increasing access to education . <\s>
<s> It estimated that if the average United States worker had completed just one more year of school , it would add an additional $ 105 billion in growth to the country 's economy over five years . <\s>
<s> During the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940 , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor . <\s>
<s> High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work . <\s>
<s> In fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees . <\s>
<s> This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers . <\s>
<s> Education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy . <\s>
<s> Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap . <\s>
<s> It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries . <\s>
<s> John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality . <\s>
<s> In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism , where unions have remained strong , they concluded `` The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion , including high levels of income inequality , high relative and absolute poverty rates , poor and unequal educational outcomes , poor health outcomes , and high rates of crime and incarceration . '' <\s>
<s> At the same time , the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes . <\s>
<s> Despite popular prejudices to the contrary , the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available . <\s>
<s> Sociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization , which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that did n't experience steep surges in inequality . <\s>
<s> He points out that nations with high rates of unionization , particularly in Scandinavia , have very low levels of inequality , and concludes `` the historical pattern is clear ; the cross-national pattern is clear : high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa . <\s>
<s> Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale . <\s>
<s> When rich countries trade with poor countries , the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages . <\s>
<s> Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States . <\s>
<s> He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . <\s>
<s> However , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . <\s>
<s> Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . <\s>
<s> They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes . <\s>
<s> Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15 % of rising income inequality . <\s>
<s> Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries . <\s>
<s> In many countries , there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market . <\s>
<s> Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap . <\s>
<s> On average , women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work , and may be less willing to travel or relocate . <\s>
<s> Thomas Sowell , in his book Knowledge and Decisions , claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy , but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference . <\s>
<s> A U.S. Census 's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men . <\s>
<s> The income gap in other countries ranges from 53 % in Botswana to -40 % in Bahrain . <\s>
<s> Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development . <\s>
<s> According to Kuznets , countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth . <\s>
<s> As a country develops , it acquires more capital , which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality . <\s>
<s> Eventually , through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs , more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality . <\s>
<s> Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality , Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve . <\s>
<s> Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data . <\s>
<s> However , more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak . <\s>
<s> Kuznets ' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time . <\s>
<s> As an example , income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter . <\s>
<s> However , recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s . <\s>
<s> This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets ' theory . <\s>
<s> It may be possible that another Kuznets ' cycle is occurring , specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector . <\s>
<s> This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets ' cycles to be in effect at any given time . <\s>
<s> Wealth concentration is a theoretical process by which , under certain conditions , newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities . <\s>
<s> According to this theory , those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth , thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth . <\s>
<s> Over time , wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society . <\s>
<s> Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital than economic growth , and that larger fortunes generate higher returns . <\s>
<s> Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non-market force known as `` rent-seeking '' . <\s>
<s> While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation , greater productivity , etc. , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , profits and large compensation . <\s>
<s> A better explainer of growing inequality , according to Stiglitz , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them . <\s>
<s> This process , known to economists as rent-seeking , brings income not from creation of wealth but from `` grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort '' <\s>
<s> Effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems , and lower rates of social goods , a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption , and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption . <\s>
<s> For the top 21 industrialised countries , counting each person equally , life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries . <\s>
<s> A similar relationship exists among US states . <\s>
<s> 2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem . <\s>
<s> Increasing inequality harms economic growth . <\s>
<s> High and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth . <\s>
<s> Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict . <\s>
<s> Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth . <\s>
<s> British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems , and lower rates of social goods in countries and states with higher inequality . <\s>
<s> Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US , they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality , than in countries and states with large differences in household income . <\s>
<s> For most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives . <\s>
<s> This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries , where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases , but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world . <\s>
<s> Americans live no longer on average than Greeks or New Zealanders , though the USA has a higher GDP per capita . <\s>
<s> Life expectancy in Sweden and Japan – where income was more equally distributed – was longer . <\s>
<s> In recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality . <\s>
<s> Creating an index of `` Health and Social Problems '' from nine factors , authors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett found health and social problems `` more common in countries with bigger income inequalities '' , and more common among states in the US with larger income inequalities . <\s>
<s> Other studies have confirmed this relationship . <\s>
<s> The UNICEF index of `` child well-being in rich countries '' , studying 40 indicators in 22 countries , correlates with greater equality but not per capita income . <\s>
<s> Crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society . <\s>
<s> Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions . <\s>
<s> There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger . <\s>
<s> Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries , as well as studying areas within countries . <\s>
<s> Daly et al. 2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality . <\s>
<s> They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state . <\s>
<s> Fajnzylber et al. found a similar relationship worldwide . <\s>
<s> Among comments in academic literature on the relationship between homicides and inequality are . <\s>
<s> Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic . <\s>
<s> A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five , is an example of reduced `` distributive efficiency '' within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility . <\s>
<s> An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare ; while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person . <\s>
<s> Thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person decreases as a person becomes richer . <\s>
<s> From this standpoint , for any given amount of wealth in society , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility . <\s>
<s> Some studies have found evidence for this theory , noting that in societies where inequality is lower , population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher . <\s>
<s> Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption , rather than income should be the measure of inequality , and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US . <\s>
<s> Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that `` the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , '' and consumption is more important than income . <\s>
<s> According to Johnson , Smeeding , and Tory , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986 . <\s>
<s> The debate is summarized in `` The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor '' by journalist Thomas B. Edsall . <\s>
<s> Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality , and the CBO 's study found consumption data not `` adequately '' capturing `` consumption by high-income households '' as it does their income , though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income . <\s>
<s> Central Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that `` systematic economic inequalities , within the United States and around the world , have created deep financial ' fault lines ' that have made crises more likely to happen than in the past '' – the Financial crisis of 2007–08 being the most recent example . <\s>
<s> To compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power , political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners – particularly to buy homes – and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low . <\s>
<s> This has given the American economy a tendency to go `` from bubble to bubble '' fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation . <\s>
<s> According to International Monetary Fund economists , inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells . <\s>
<s> High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity , but also the quality of a country 's institutions and high levels of education . <\s>
<s> According to IMF staff economists , if the income share of the top 20 percent increases , then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down . <\s>
<s> In contrast , an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent is associated with higher GDP growth . <\s>
<s> The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic , social , and political channels . <\s>
<s> According to economists David Castells-Quintana and Vicente Royuela , increasing inequality harms economic growth . <\s>
<s> High and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth . <\s>
<s> Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict . <\s>
<s> Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth . <\s>
<s> Economist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand . <\s>
<s> Economist Branko Milanovic , wrote in 2001 that , The view that income inequality harms growth – or that improved equality can help sustain growth – has become more widely held in recent years . <\s>
<s> The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development . <\s>
<s> When physical capital mattered most , savings and investments were key . <\s>
<s> Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital . <\s>
<s> But now that human capital is scarcer than machines , widespread education has become the secret to growth . <\s>
<s> In 1993 , Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development . <\s>
<s> A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth . <\s>
<s> He showed that , in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach , inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation and higher level of fertility , and thereby lower levels of growth . <\s>
<s> He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation , which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment . <\s>
<s> Perotti concluded that , more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education . <\s>
<s> Both are reflected in higher rates of growth . <\s>
<s> Also , very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable , which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth . <\s>
<s> Research by Harvard economist Robert Barro , found that there is `` little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment '' . <\s>
<s> According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000 , high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries . <\s>
<s> A study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less , but no correlation after ten years . <\s>
<s> Studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time , and a negative impact on the duration of growth . <\s>
<s> Studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the Kuznets curve hypothesis , which states that with economic development , inequality first increases , then decreases . <\s>
<s> Economist Thomas Piketty challenges this notion , claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and `` violent economic and political shocks '' reduced inequality . <\s>
<s> Moreover , Piketty argues that the `` magical '' Kuznets curve hypothesis , with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run , can not account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s . <\s>
<s> Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development . <\s>
<s> According to a 1955 review , savings by the wealthy , if these increase with inequality , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand . <\s>
<s> A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality . <\s>
<s> Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development . <\s>
<s> Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth . <\s>
<s> IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth . <\s>
<s> Developing countries with high inequality have `` succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years '' but `` longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution . '' <\s>
<s> While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth . <\s>
<s> The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality . <\s>
<s> For instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction . <\s>
<s> In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon : `` While economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty . '' <\s>
<s> In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system . <\s>
<s> Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements . <\s>
<s> Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building , In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land . <\s>
<s> Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency . <\s>
<s> A number of researchers , argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality . <\s>
<s> David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased . <\s>
<s> Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods , for example , in East New York , rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units . <\s>
<s> The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace . <\s>
<s> Firstly , certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone , such as the costs of housing , pensions , education and health care . <\s>
<s> If the state does not provide these services , then for those on lower incomes , the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances . <\s>
<s> Secondly , aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt . <\s>
<s> The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability . <\s>
<s> The smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more environmental degradation . <\s>
<s> This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy , it increases their yearly carbon emissions . <\s>
<s> This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve . <\s>
<s> It should be noted here however that in certain cases , with great economic inequality , there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards ... . <\s>
<s> Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier . <\s>
<s> If there were fewer people however , this multiplier would be lower , and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well . <\s>
<s> As such , the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well . <\s>
<s> If , population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level , human inequality can be addressed/corrected , while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage . <\s>
<s> Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners , creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock . <\s>
<s> By contrast , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary . <\s>
<s> In order to rectify this situation , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product . <\s>
<s> Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force , and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force . <\s>
<s> However , Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property , and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves . <\s>
<s> John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole , including the poorest members . <\s>
<s> Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice . <\s>
<s> Some see Rawls 's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism ; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls 's theory of justice . <\s>
<s> The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of `` capability deprivation '' . <\s>
<s> Unlike neoliberalism , which `` defines well-being as utility maximization '' , economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself . <\s>
<s> Its goal is to `` wid people 's choices and the level of their achieved well-being '' through increasing functionings , capabilities and agency . <\s>
<s> When a person 's capabilities are lowered , they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise . <\s>
<s> An old , ill man can not earn as much as a healthy young man ; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home . <\s>
<s> There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic , or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives . <\s>
<s> As a result , income and economic inequality increases , and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid . <\s>
<s> To prevent such inequality , this approach believes it 's important to have political freedom , economic facilities , social opportunities , transparency guarantees , and protective security to ensure that people are n't denied their functionings , capabilities , and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income . <\s>
<s> The University of Chicago is a private research university in Chicago . <\s>

<s> Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller , the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890 ; William Rainey Harper became the university 's first president in 1891 , and the first classes were held in 1892 . <\s>
<s> Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago 's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility . <\s>
<s> With Harper 's vision in mind , the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities , an international organization of leading research universities , in 1900 . <\s>
<s> The University of Chicago was created and incorporated as a coeducational , secular institution in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D . <\s>
<s> Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field . <\s>
<s> While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment , it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings . <\s>
<s> The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus ' first building , Cobb Lecture Hall , and matched Marshall Field 's pledge of $ 100,000 . <\s>
<s> Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson , Martin A. Ryerson Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel , who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall , and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum , a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities . <\s>
<s> In the 1890s , the University of Chicago , fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students , affiliated with several regional colleges and universities : Des Moines College , Kalamazoo College , Butler University , and Stetson University . <\s>
<s> In 1896 , the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll , Illinois . <\s>
<s> Under the terms of the affiliation , the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university , to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals , to make no faculty appointment without the university 's approval , and to send copies of examinations for suggestions . <\s>
<s> The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years , and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago . <\s>
<s> A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago , and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work . <\s>
<s> The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost ; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses ; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost . <\s>
<s> The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice . <\s>
<s> Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program , as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part , and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university . <\s>
<s> The program passed into history by 1910 . <\s>
<s> In 1929 , the university 's fifth president , Robert Maynard Hutchins , took office ; the university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure . <\s>
<s> Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics , instituted the undergraduate college 's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core , and organized the university 's graduate work into its current four divisions . <\s>
<s> In 1933 , Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university . <\s>
<s> During his term , the University of Chicago Hospitals finished construction and enrolled its first medical students . <\s>
<s> Also , the Committee on Social Thought , an institution distinctive of the university , was created . <\s>
<s> In the early 1950s , student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood . <\s>
<s> In response , the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park , which profoundly affected both the neighborhood 's architecture and street plan . <\s>
<s> During this period the university , like Shimer College and 10 others , adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college ; in addition , students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year , having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses . <\s>
<s> The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s , beginning in 1962 , when students occupied President George Beadle 's office in a protest over the university 's off-campus rental policies . <\s>
<s> After continued turmoil , a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report . <\s>
<s> The report , a two-page statement of the university 's policy in `` social and political action , '' declared that `` To perform its mission in the society , a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions , passions , and pressures . '' <\s>
<s> The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university 's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s . <\s>

<s> The Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles , each surrounded by buildings , bordering one larger quadrangle . <\s>
<s> The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb , Shepley , Rutan and Coolidge , Holabird & Roche , and other architectural firms in a mixture of the Victorian Gothic and Collegiate Gothic styles , patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford . <\s>
<s> Mitchell Tower , for example , is modeled after Oxford 's Magdalen Tower , and the university Commons , Hutchinson Hall , replicates Christ Church Hall . <\s>
<s> After the 1940s , the Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles . <\s>
<s> In 1955 , Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan , which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway , including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle ; a series of arts buildings ; a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university 's School of Social Service Administration ; , a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone , and the Regenstein Library , the largest building on campus , a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch of the Chicago firm Skidmore , Owings & Merrill . <\s>
<s> Another master plan , designed in 1999 and updated in 2004 , produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center , the Max Palevsky Residential Commons , South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons , a new children 's hospital , and other construction , expansions , and restorations . <\s>

<s> The Yuan dynasty , officially the Great Yuan , was the empire or ruling dynasty of China established by Kublai Khan , leader of the Mongolian Borjigin clan . <\s>
<s> Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today 's North China for decades , it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style . <\s>
<s> His realm was , by this point , isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia and Korea . <\s>
<s> It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 , after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language , while others only used their native language and the ' Phags-pa ' script . <\s>
<s> The Yuan dynasty is considered both a successor to the Mongol Empire and an imperial Chinese dynasty . <\s>
<s> It was the khanate ruled by the successors of Möngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire . <\s>
<s> In official Chinese histories , the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven , following the Song dynasty and preceding the Ming dynasty . <\s>
<s> The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan , yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu . <\s>
<s> In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name , Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty . <\s>
<s> In 1271 , Kublai Khan imposed the name Great Yuan , establishing the Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> `` Dà Yuán '' is from the sentence `` 大哉乾元 '' in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes section regarding Qián . <\s>
<s> The counterpart in Mongolian language was Dai Ön Ulus , also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus . <\s>
<s> In Mongolian , Dai Ön is often used in conjunction with the `` Yeke Mongghul Ulus '' , resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus , meaning `` Great Yuan Great Mongol State '' . <\s>
<s> The Yuan dynasty is also known as the `` Mongol dynasty '' or `` Mongol Dynasty of China '' , similar to the names `` Manchu dynasty '' or `` Manchu Dynasty of China '' for the Qing dynasty . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the Yuan is sometimes known as the `` Empire of the Great Khan '' or `` Khanate of the Great Khan '' , which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps , since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1271 . <\s>
<s> Genghis Khan united the Mongol and Turkic tribes of the steppes and became Great Khan in 1206 . <\s>
<s> He and his successors expanded the Mongol empire across Asia . <\s>
<s> Under the reign of Genghis ' third son , Ögedei Khan , the Mongols destroyed the weakened Jin dynasty in 1234 , conquering most of northern China . <\s>
<s> Ögedei offered his nephew Kublai a position in Xingzhou , Hebei . <\s>
<s> Kublai was unable to read Chinese but had several Han Chinese teachers attached to him since his early years by his mother Sorghaghtani . <\s>
<s> He sought the counsel of Chinese Buddhist and Confucian advisers . <\s>
<s> Möngke Khan succeeded Ögedei 's son , Güyük , as Great Khan in 1251 . <\s>
<s> He granted his brother Kublai control over Mongol held territories in China . <\s>
<s> Kublai built schools for Confucian scholars , issued paper money , revived Chinese rituals , and endorsed policies that stimulated agricultural and commercial growth . <\s>
<s> He adopted as his capital city Kaiping in Inner Mongolia , later renamed Shangdu . <\s>
<s> Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin . <\s>
<s> Two Han Chinese leaders , Shi Tianze , Liu Heima , and the Khitan Xiao Zhala defected and commanded the 3 Tumens in the Mongol army . <\s>
<s> Liu Heima and Shi Tianze served Ogödei Khan . <\s>
<s> Liu Heima and Shi Tianxiang led armies against Western Xia for the Mongols . <\s>
<s> There were 4 Han Tumens and 3 Khitan Tumens , with each Tumen consisting of 10,000 troops . <\s>
<s> The three Khitan Generals Shimobeidier , Tabuyir and Xiaozhacizhizizhongxi commanded the three Khitan Tumens and the four Han Generals Zhang Rou , Yan Shi , Shi Tianze , and Liu Heima commanded the four Han tumens under Ogödei Khan . <\s>
<s> Shi Tianze was a Han Chinese who lived in the Jin dynasty . <\s>
<s> Interethnic marriage between Han and Jurchen became common at this time . <\s>
<s> His father was Shi Bingzhi . <\s>
<s> Shi Bingzhi was married to a Jurchen woman and a Han Chinese woman ; it is unknown which of them was Shi Tianze 's mother . <\s>
<s> Shi Tianze was married to two Jurchen women , a Han Chinese woman , and a Korean woman , and his son Shi Gang was born to one of his Jurchen wives . <\s>
<s> The surnames of his Jurchen wives were Mo-nien and Na-ho ; the surname of his Korean wife was Li ; and the surname of his Han Chinese wife was Shi . <\s>
<s> Shi Tianze defected to Mongol forces upon their invasion of the Jin dynasty . <\s>
<s> His son Shi Gang married a Kerait woman ; the Kerait were Mongolified Turkic people and were considered part of the `` Mongol nation '' . <\s>
<s> Shi Tianze , Zhang Rou , and Yan Shi and other high ranking Chinese who served in the Jin dynasty and defected to the Mongols helped build the structure for the administration of the new state . <\s>
<s> Chagaan and Zhang Rou jointly launched an attack on the Song dynasty ordered by Töregene Khatun . <\s>
<s> Möngke Khan commenced a military campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China . <\s>
<s> The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256 . <\s>
<s> He died in 1259 without a successor . <\s>
<s> Kublai returned from fighting the Song in 1260 when he learned that his brother , Ariq Böke , was challenging his claim to the throne . <\s>
<s> Kublai convened a kurultai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan . <\s>
<s> A rival kurultai in Mongolia proclaimed Ariq Böke Great Khan , beginning a civil war . <\s>
<s> Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources . <\s>
<s> He bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting the Chinese era name of Zhongtong . <\s>
<s> Ariq Böke was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered in 1264 . <\s>
<s> All of the three western khanates became functionally autonomous , although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai as Great Khan . <\s>
<s> Civil strife had permanently divided the Mongol Empire . <\s>
<s> Instability troubled the early years of Kublai Khan 's reign . <\s>
<s> Ogedei 's grandson Kaidu refused to submit to Kublai and threatened the western frontier of Kublai 's domain . <\s>
<s> The hostile but weakened Song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south . <\s>
<s> Kublai secured the northeast border in 1259 by installing the hostage prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea , making it a Mongol tributary state . <\s>
<s> Kublai was also threatened by domestic unrest . <\s>
<s> Li Tan , the son-in-law of a powerful official , instigated a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262 . <\s>
<s> After successfully suppressing the revolt , Kublai curbed the influence of the Han Chinese advisers in his court . <\s>
<s> He feared that his dependence on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song . <\s>
<s> Kublai 's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects . <\s>
<s> He instituted the reforms proposed by his Chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy , expanding the circulation of paper money , and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron . <\s>
<s> He restored the Imperial Secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties unchanged . <\s>
<s> However , Kublai rejected plans to revive the Confucian imperial examinations and divided Yuan society into three , later four , classes with the Han Chinese occupying the lowest rank . <\s>
<s> Kublai 's Chinese advisers still wielded significant power in the government , but their official rank was nebulous . <\s>
<s> Kublai readied the move of the Mongol capital from Karakorum in Mongolia to Khanbaliq in 1264 , constructing a new city near the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu , now modern Beijing , in 1266 . <\s>
<s> In 1271 , Kublai formally claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared that 1272 was the first year of the Great Yuan in the style of a traditional Chinese dynasty . <\s>
<s> The name of the dynasty originated from the I Ching and describes the `` origin of the universe '' or a `` primal force '' . <\s>
<s> Kublai proclaimed Khanbaliq the `` Great Capital '' or Daidu of the dynasty . <\s>
<s> The era name was changed to Zhiyuan to herald a new era of Chinese history . <\s>
<s> The adoption of a dynastic name legitimized Mongol rule by integrating the government into the narrative of traditional Chinese political succession . <\s>
<s> Khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration , while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes . <\s>
<s> Kublai Khan promoted commercial , scientific , and cultural growth . <\s>
<s> He supported the merchants of the Silk Road trade network by protecting the Mongol postal system , constructing infrastructure , providing loans that financed trade caravans , and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes . <\s>
<s> Pax Mongolica , Mongol peace , enabled the spread of technologies , commodities , and culture between China and the West . <\s>
<s> Kublai expanded the Grand Canal from southern China to Daidu in the north . <\s>
<s> Mongol rule was cosmopolitan under Kublai Khan . <\s>
<s> He welcomed foreign visitors to his court , such as the Venetian merchant Marco Polo , who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China . <\s>
<s> Marco Polo 's travels would later inspire many others like Christopher Columbus to chart a passage to the Far East in search of its legendary wealth . <\s>
<s> During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu , the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou , while the newly established Jin dynasty in the north appointed Kong Duanyou 's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng . <\s>
<s> From that time up until the Yuan dynasty , there were two Duke Yanshengs , once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou . <\s>
<s> During the Yuan dynasty , the Emperor Kublai Khan invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to return to Qufu . <\s>
<s> Kong Zhu refused , and gave up the title , so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng . <\s>
<s> The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day . <\s>
<s> Confucius 's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000 . <\s>
<s> During the Yuan dynasty , one of Confucius ' descendants moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there after marrying a Korean woman . <\s>
<s> After strengthening his government in northern China , Kublai pursued an expansionist policy in line with the tradition of Mongol and Chinese imperialism . <\s>
<s> He renewed a massive drive against the Song dynasty to the south . <\s>
<s> Kublai besieged Xiangyang between 1268 and 1273 , the last obstacle in his way to capture the rich Yangzi River basin . <\s>
<s> An unsuccessful naval expedition was undertaken against Japan in 1274 . <\s>
<s> Kublai captured the Song capital of Hangzhou in 1276 , the wealthiest city of China . <\s>
<s> Song loyalists escaped from the capital and enthroned a young child as Emperor Bing of Song . <\s>
<s> The Mongols defeated the loyalists at the battle of Yamen in 1279 . <\s>
<s> The last Song emperor drowned , bringing an end to the Song dynasty . <\s>
<s> The conquest of the Song reunited northern and southern China for the first time in three hundred years . <\s>
<s> Kublai 's government faced financial difficulties after 1279 . <\s>
<s> Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury . <\s>
<s> Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals . <\s>
<s> Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems . <\s>
<s> Kublai 's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon . <\s>
<s> Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam , Champa , and Java , but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma . <\s>
<s> The expeditions were hampered by disease , an inhospitable climate , and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols . <\s>
<s> The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Bạch Đằng . <\s>
<s> The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran clan before they migrated under Trần Kinh to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Trần dynasty which ruled Vietnam Đại Việt , and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn in 1282 . <\s>
<s> Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion . <\s>
<s> The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as `` Northern bandits '' . <\s>
<s> Annam , Burma , and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> Following the conquest of Dali in 1253 , the former ruling Duan dynasty were appointed as governors-general , recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan , Ming , and Qing-era governments , principally in the province of Yunnan . <\s>
<s> Succession for the Yuan dynasty , however , was an intractable problem , later causing much strife and internal struggle . <\s>
<s> This emerged as early as the end of Kublai 's reign . <\s>
<s> Kublai originally named his eldest son , Zhenjin , as the Crown Prince , but he died before Kublai in 1285 . <\s>
<s> Thus , Zhenjin 's third son , with the support of his mother Kökejin and the minister Bayan , succeeded the throne and ruled as Temür Khan , or Emperor Chengzong , from 1294 to 1307 . <\s>
<s> Temür Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather . <\s>
<s> He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam , which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades . <\s>
<s> However , the corruption in the Yuan dynasty began during the reign of Temür Khan . <\s>
<s> The fourth Yuan emperor , Buyantu Khan , was a competent emperor . <\s>
<s> He was the first Yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream Chinese culture after the reign of Kublai , to the discontent of some Mongol elite . <\s>
<s> He had been mentored by Li Meng , a Confucian academic . <\s>
<s> He made many reforms , including the liquidation of the Department of State Affairs , which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials . <\s>
<s> Starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials , testing their knowledge on significant historical works . <\s>
<s> Also , he codified much of the law , as well as publishing or translating a number of Chinese books and works . <\s>
<s> Emperor Gegeen Khan , Ayurbarwada 's son and successor , ruled for only two years , from 1321 to 1323 . <\s>
<s> He continued his father 's policies to reform the government based on the Confucian principles , with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor Baiju . <\s>
<s> During his reign , the Da Yuan Tong Zhi , a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan dynasty begun by his father , was formally promulgated . <\s>
<s> Gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction , perhaps steppe elite opposed to Confucian reforms . <\s>
<s> They placed Yesün Temür on the throne , and , after an unsuccessful attempt to calm the princes , he also succumbed to regicide . <\s>
<s> When Yesün Temür died in Shangdu in 1328 , Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by the Qipchaq commander El Temür . <\s>
<s> He was installed as the emperor in Khanbaliq , while Yesün Temür 's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yesün Temür 's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah . <\s>
<s> Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty , Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals . <\s>
<s> Afterwards , Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala , who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey , and announced Khanbaliq 's intent to welcome him . <\s>
<s> However , Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür . <\s>
<s> He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür , and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne . <\s>
<s> Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world . <\s>
<s> However , he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign . <\s>
<s> El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords , whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty . <\s>
<s> Due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür , Tugh Temür is known for his cultural contribution instead . <\s>
<s> He adopted many measures honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values . <\s>
<s> His most concrete effort to patronize Chinese learning was founding the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature , first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake `` a number of tasks relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment '' . <\s>
<s> The academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books , but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named Jingshi Dadian . <\s>
<s> Tugh Temür supported Zhu Xi 's Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself in Buddhism . <\s>
<s> After the death of Tugh Temür in 1332 and subsequent death of Rinchinbal the same year , the 13-year-old Toghun Temür , the last of the nine successors of Kublai Khan , was summoned back from Guangxi and succeeded to the throne . <\s>
<s> After El Temür 's death , Bayan became as powerful an official as El Temür had been in the beginning of his long reign . <\s>
<s> As Toghun Temür grew , he came to disapprove of Bayan 's autocratic rule . <\s>
<s> In 1340 he allied himself with Bayan 's nephew Toqto ' a , who was in discord with Bayan , and banished Bayan by coup . <\s>
<s> With the dismissal of Bayan , Toghtogha seized the power of the court . <\s>
<s> His first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit . <\s>
<s> He also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government . <\s>
<s> One of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the Liao , Jin , and Song dynasties , which were eventually completed in 1345 . <\s>
<s> Yet , Toghtogha resigned his office with the approval of Toghun Temür , marking the end of his first administration , and he was not called back until 1349 . <\s>
<s> The final years of the Yuan dynasty were marked by struggle , famine , and bitterness among the populace . <\s>
<s> In time , Kublai Khan 's successors lost all influence on other Mongol lands across Asia , while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese . <\s>
<s> Gradually , they lost influence in China as well . <\s>
<s> The reigns of the later Yuan emperors were short and marked by intrigues and rivalries . <\s>
<s> Uninterested in administration , they were separated from both the army and the populace , and China was torn by dissension and unrest . <\s>
<s> Outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening Yuan armies . <\s>
<s> From the late 1340s onwards , people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts , floods and the resulting famines , and the government 's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support . <\s>
<s> In 1351 , the Red Turban Rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising . <\s>
<s> In 1354 , when Toghtogha led a large army to crush the Red Turban rebels , Toghun Temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal . <\s>
<s> This resulted in Toghun Temür 's restoration of power on the one hand and a rapid weakening of the central government on the other . <\s>
<s> He had no choice but to rely on local warlords ' military power , and gradually lost his interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles . <\s>
<s> He fled north to Shangdu from Khanbaliq in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the Míng dynasty , founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in the south . <\s>
<s> He had tried to regain Khanbaliq , which eventually failed ; he died in Yingchang two years later . <\s>
<s> Yingchang was seized by the Ming shortly after his death . <\s>
<s> Some royal family members still lived in Henan today . <\s>
<s> A rich cultural diversity developed during the Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> The major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular . <\s>
<s> The political unity of China and much of central Asia promoted trade between East and West . <\s>
<s> The Mongols ' extensive West Asian and European contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange . <\s>
<s> The other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much influenced China . <\s>
<s> It had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia until its decline ; the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia , the Ilkhanate , encouraged this development . <\s>
<s> Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government , and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period . <\s>
<s> The Muslims of the Yuan dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography , astronomy , medicine , clothing , and diet in East Asia . <\s>
<s> Eastern crops such as carrots , turnips , new varieties of lemons , eggplants , and melons , high-quality granulated sugar , and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> Western musical instruments were introduced to enrich Chinese performing arts . <\s>
<s> From this period dates the conversion to Islam , by Muslims of Central Asia , of growing numbers of Chinese in the northwest and southwest . <\s>
<s> Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration . <\s>
<s> Buddhism flourished , although Taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism from the Yuan government . <\s>
<s> Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics , which had fallen into disuse in north China during the period of disunity , were reinstated by the Yuan court , probably in the hope of maintaining order over Han society . <\s>
<s> Advances were realized in the fields of travel literature , cartography , geography , and scientific education . <\s>
<s> The first recorded travels by Europeans to China and back date from this time . <\s>
<s> The most famous traveler of the period was the Venetian Marco Polo , whose account of his trip to `` Cambaluc , '' the capital of the Great Khan , and of life there astounded the people of Europe . <\s>
<s> The account of his travels , Il milione , appeared about the year 1299 . <\s>
<s> Some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo 's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China , tea houses , which would have been a prominent sight since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture , as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan . <\s>
<s> Some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders since many of the places he named were in Persian . <\s>
<s> The Yuan undertook extensive public works . <\s>
<s> Among Kublai Khan 's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer Guo Shoujing , who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year , which was only 26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar 's measurement . <\s>
<s> Road and water communications were reorganized and improved . <\s>
<s> To provide against possible famines , granaries were ordered built throughout the empire . <\s>
<s> The city of Beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes , hills and mountains , and parks . <\s>
<s> During the Yuan period , Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China , which was completely renovated . <\s>
<s> These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe . <\s>
<s> Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering . <\s>
<s> Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop , sorghum , along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation . <\s>
<s> The Yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China . <\s>
<s> In the historiography of Mongolia , it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire . <\s>
<s> Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven , and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be `` the beginning of an infinite number of beings , the foundation of peace and happiness , state power , the dream of many peoples , besides it there is nothing great or precious . '' <\s>
<s> In traditional historiography of China , on the other hand , the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the Song dynasty and the Ming dynasty . <\s>
<s> Note , however , Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan 's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271 , partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu . <\s>
<s> Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views , there also exist Chinese people who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China , but rather as a period of foreign domination . <\s>
<s> The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens , and that China stagnated economically and scientifically . <\s>
<s> The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire , including that of the Han Chinese , Khitans , Jurchens , Mongols , and Tibetan Buddhists . <\s>
<s> While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties , the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures . <\s>
<s> The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang , Song , as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties . <\s>
<s> Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai 's early court , and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai 's reign . <\s>
<s> This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil , military , and censorial offices , including the Central Secretariat to manage civil affairs , the Privy Council to manage military affairs , and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection . <\s>
<s> The actual functions of both central and local government institutions , however , showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions , due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , such a civilian bureaucracy , with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was responsible for most other governmental agencies , was created in China . <\s>
<s> At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs that mainly dealt with finance was established , but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards . <\s>
<s> While the existence of these central government departments and the Six Ministries gave a Sinicized image in the Yuan administration , the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how Mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions . <\s>
<s> For example , the authority of the Yuan legal system , the Ministry of Justice , did not extend to legal cases involving Mongols and Semuren , who had separate courts of justice . <\s>
<s> Cases involving members of more than one ethnic group were decided by a mixed board consisting of Chinese and Mongols . <\s>
<s> Another example was the insignificance of the Ministry of War compared with native Chinese dynasties , as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council . <\s>
<s> Since its invention in 1269 , the ' Phags-pa script , a unified script for spelling Mongolian , Tibetan , and Chinese languages , was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty . <\s>
<s> Most of the Emperors could not master written Chinese , but they could generally converse well in the language . <\s>
<s> The Mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with Mongol clans , the Onggirat , and the Ikeres , kept the imperial blood purely Mongol until the reign of Tugh Temur , whose mother was a Tangut concubine . <\s>
<s> The Mongol Emperors had built large palaces and pavilions , but some still continued to live as nomads at times . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , a few other Yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities ; an example is Tugh Temur , who wrote poetry , painted , read Chinese classical texts , and ordered the compilation of books . <\s>
<s> The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure , with income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty . <\s>
<s> The Mongols practiced debt slavery , and by 1290 in all parts of the Mongol Empire commoners were selling their children into slavery . <\s>
<s> Seeing this as damaging to the Mongol nation , Kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of Mongols . <\s>
<s> Kublai wished to persuade the Chinese that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his Mongolian credentials with his own people . <\s>
<s> He set up a civilian administration to rule , built a capital within China , supported Chinese religions and culture , and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court . <\s>
<s> But at the same time he never abandoned his Mongolian heritage . <\s>
<s> In the China of the Yuan , or Mongol era , various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development , including the areas of painting , mathematics , calligraphy , poetry , and theater , with many great artists and writers being famous today . <\s>
<s> Due to the coming together of painting , poetry , and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals , though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others . <\s>
<s> Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting , poetry , and calligraphy , the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together . <\s>
<s> In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters . <\s>
<s> In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era . <\s>
<s> In Yuan poetry , the main development was the qu , which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets . <\s>
<s> Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time , and the other way around , with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu . <\s>
<s> One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form . <\s>
<s> One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry , painting , and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art . <\s>
<s> Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current , vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show . <\s>
<s> Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China , relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty , which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin , in Japan . <\s>
<s> There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty , such as Buddhism , Islam , and Christianity . <\s>
<s> The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China . <\s>
<s> However , unlike the western khanates , the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam . <\s>
<s> Instead , Kublai Khan , the founder of the Yuan dynasty , favored Buddhism , especially the Tibetan variants . <\s>
<s> As a result , Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion . <\s>
<s> The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs was set up in Khanbaliq to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire . <\s>
<s> Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism , other religions became less important . <\s>
<s> He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor at court . <\s>
<s> Before the end of the Yuan dynasty , 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor , thereby enjoying special power . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art . <\s>
<s> Mongolian Buddhist translations , almost all from Tibetan originals , began on a large scale after 1300 . <\s>
<s> Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions . <\s>
<s> A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language . <\s>
<s> Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era . <\s>
<s> The mathematician Zhu Shijie solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients , equivalent to modern matrices . <\s>
<s> Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown . <\s>
<s> His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns , written in 1303 . <\s>
<s> The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascal 's triangle . <\s>
<s> The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book . <\s>
<s> Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars . <\s>
<s> He was one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry . <\s>
<s> Gou derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations . <\s>
<s> His calendar , the Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons , was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> The calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of Song dynasty astronomer Shen Kuo or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers . <\s>
<s> There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences in the Shoushi calendar , but Mongol rulers were known to be interested in Muslim calendars . <\s>
<s> Mathematical knowledge from the Middle East was introduced to China under the Mongols , and Muslim astronomers brought Arabic numerals to China in the 13th century . <\s>
<s> The physicians of the Yuan court came from diverse cultures . <\s>
<s> Healers were divided into non-Mongol physicians called otachi and traditional Mongol shamans . <\s>
<s> The Mongols characterized otachi doctors by their use of herbal remedies , which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of Mongol shamanism . <\s>
<s> Physicians received official support from the Yuan government and were given special legal privileges . <\s>
<s> Kublai created the Imperial Academy of Medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors . <\s>
<s> Confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with Confucian virtues . <\s>
<s> The Chinese medical tradition of the Yuan had `` Four Great Schools '' that the Yuan inherited from the Jin dynasty . <\s>
<s> All four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation , but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine . <\s>
<s> Under the Mongols , the practice of Chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire . <\s>
<s> Chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the Mongols as they expanded towards the west . <\s>
<s> Chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture , moxibustion , pulse diagnosis , and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire . <\s>
<s> Several medical advances were made in the Yuan period . <\s>
<s> The physician Wei Yilin invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints , which he performed using anesthetics . <\s>
<s> The Mongol physician Hu Sihui described the importance of a healthy diet in a 1330 medical treatise . <\s>
<s> Western medicine was also practiced in China by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court , where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or Muslim medicine . <\s>
<s> The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Kublai . <\s>
<s> Huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court . <\s>
<s> Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine because its humoral system contradicted the yin-yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine . <\s>
<s> No Chinese translation of Western medical works is known , but it is possible that the Chinese had access to Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine . <\s>
<s> The Mongol rulers patronized the Yuan printing industry . <\s>
<s> Chinese printing technology was transferred to the Mongols through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries . <\s>
<s> Some Yuan documents such as Wang Zhen 's Nong Shu were printed with earthenware movable type , a technology invented in the 12th century . <\s>
<s> However , most published works were still produced through traditional block printing techniques . <\s>
<s> The publication of a Taoist text inscribed with the name of Töregene Khatun , Ögedei 's wife , is one of the first printed works sponsored by the Mongols . <\s>
<s> In 1273 , the Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate , a government-sponsored printing office . <\s>
<s> The Yuan government established centers for printing throughout China . <\s>
<s> Local schools and government agencies were funded to support the publishing of books . <\s>
<s> One of the more notable applications of printing technology was the chao , the paper money of the Yuan . <\s>
<s> Chao were made from the bark of mulberry trees . <\s>
<s> The Yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money , but switched to bronze plates in 1275 . <\s>
<s> The Mongols experimented with establishing the Chinese-style paper monetary system in Mongol-controlled territories outside of China . <\s>
<s> The Yuan minister Bolad was sent to Iran , where he explained Yuan paper money to the Il-khanate court of Gaykhatu . <\s>
<s> The Il-khanate government issued paper money in 1294 , but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment . <\s>
<s> Politically , the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties . <\s>
<s> Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power , the Mongols and the Semuren largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture , and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong `` colonial '' coloration . <\s>
<s> The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule . <\s>
<s> The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty , and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century . <\s>
<s> In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate . <\s>
<s> Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty . <\s>
<s> In response to an objection against the use of `` barbarians '' in his government , the Yongle Emperor answered that Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty , who employed only `` Mongols and Tartars '' and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them . <\s>
<s> At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China , the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia , using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands . <\s>
<s> Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq , Almaliq , and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers . <\s>
<s> Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called `` Right Alan Guard '' which was combined with `` recently surrendered '' soldiers , Mongols , and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi . <\s>
<s> After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan , foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them . <\s>
<s> The Mongol appointed Governor of Samarqand was a Qara-Khitay , held the title Taishi , familiar with Chinese culture his name was Ahai <\s>
<s> Despite the high position given to Muslims , some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely discriminated against them , restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision , as well as Kosher butchering for Jews , forcing them to eat food the Mongol way . <\s>
<s> Toward the end , corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols . <\s>
<s> The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat . <\s>
<s> Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant `` barracks '' and could also mean `` thanks '' . <\s>
<s> Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them . <\s>
<s> During the war fighting the Mongols , among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang 's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng . <\s>
<s> The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding . <\s>
<s> The historian Frederick W. Mote wrote that the usage of the term `` social classes '' for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth , but just entailed `` degrees of privilege '' to which they were entitled institutionally and legally , so a person 's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing , since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese while there were less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated . <\s>
<s> The reason for the order of the classes and the reason why people were placed in a certain class was the date they surrendered to the Mongols , and had nothing to do with their ethnicity . <\s>
<s> The earlier they surrendered to the Mongols , the higher they were placed , the more the held out , the lower they were ranked . <\s>
<s> The Northern Chinese were ranked higher and Southern Chinese were ranked lower because southern China withstood and fought to the last before caving in . <\s>
<s> Major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants . <\s>
<s> When the Mongols placed the Uighurs of the Kingdom of Qocho over the Koreans at the court the Korean King objected , then the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan rebuked the Korean King , saying that the Uighur King of Qocho was ranked higher than the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler , who in turn was ranked higher than the Korean King , who was ranked last , because the Uighurs surrendered to the Mongols first , the Karluks surrendered after the Uighurs , and the Koreans surrendered last , and that the Uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting . <\s>
<s> The Central Region , consisting of present-day Hebei , Shandong , Shanxi , the south-eastern part of present-day Inner Mongolia and the Henan areas to the north of the Yellow River , was considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly governed by the Central Secretariat at Khanbaliq ; similarly , another top-level administrative department called the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs held administrative rule over the whole of modern-day Tibet and a part of Sichuan , Qinghai and Kashmir . <\s>
<s> The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease . <\s>
<s> To function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue . <\s>
<s> In many species , the immune system can be classified into subsystems , such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system , or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity . <\s>
<s> In humans , the blood–brain barrier , blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain . <\s>
<s> Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer . <\s>
<s> Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal , resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections . <\s>
<s> In humans , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency , acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS , or the use of immunosuppressive medication . <\s>
<s> In contrast , autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms . <\s>
<s> Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 , and systemic lupus erythematosus . <\s>
<s> Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system . <\s>
<s> Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system . <\s>
<s> It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease . <\s>
<s> The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC . <\s>
<s> Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . <\s>
<s> In the 18th century , Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom . <\s>
<s> This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease . <\s>
<s> Pasteur 's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease , such as the miasma theory . <\s>
<s> It was not until Robert Koch 's 1891 proofs , for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905 , that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease . <\s>
<s> Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 , with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed . <\s>
<s> The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity . <\s>
<s> In simple terms , physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism . <\s>
<s> If a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non-specific response . <\s>
<s> Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals . <\s>
<s> If pathogens successfully evade the innate response , vertebrates possess a second layer of protection , the adaptive immune system , which is activated by the innate response . <\s>
<s> Here , the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen . <\s>
<s> This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered . <\s>
<s> Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules . <\s>
<s> In immunology , self molecules are those components of an organism 's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system . <\s>
<s> Conversely , non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules . <\s>
<s> One class of non-self molecules are called antigens and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response . <\s>
<s> Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system . <\s>
<s> The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors , which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms , or when damaged , injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals , many of which are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens . <\s>
<s> Innate immune defenses are non-specific , meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way . <\s>
<s> This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen . <\s>
<s> The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms . <\s>
<s> Several barriers protect organisms from infection , including mechanical , chemical , and biological barriers . <\s>
<s> The waxy cuticle of many leaves , the exoskeleton of insects , the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs , and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection . <\s>
<s> However , as organisms can not be completely sealed from their environments , other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs , intestines , and the genitourinary tract . <\s>
<s> In the lungs , coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract . <\s>
<s> The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens , while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms . <\s>
<s> Chemical barriers also protect against infection . <\s>
<s> The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins . <\s>
<s> Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva , tears , and breast milk are also antibacterials . <\s>
<s> Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens . <\s>
<s> In the stomach , gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens . <\s>
<s> Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and , in some cases , by changing the conditions in their environment , such as pH or available iron . <\s>
<s> This reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness . <\s>
<s> However , since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi , oral antibiotics can lead to an `` overgrowth '' of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis . <\s>
<s> There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora , such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt , helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis , inflammatory bowel diseases , urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections . <\s>
<s> Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection . <\s>
<s> The symptoms of inflammation are redness , swelling , heat , and pain , which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue . <\s>
<s> Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines , which are released by injured or infected cells . <\s>
<s> Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation , and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells . <\s>
<s> Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells ; chemokines that promote chemotaxis ; and interferons that have anti-viral effects , such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell . <\s>
<s> Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released . <\s>
<s> These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens . <\s>
<s> Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called ' phagocytes ' that engulf , or eat , pathogens or particles . <\s>
<s> Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens , but can be called to specific locations by cytokines . <\s>
<s> Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte , it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome , which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome . <\s>
<s> The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome . <\s>
<s> Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients , but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism . <\s>
<s> Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense , as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals . <\s>
<s> Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens . <\s>
<s> Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes . <\s>
<s> During the acute phase of inflammation , particularly as a result of bacterial infection , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection . <\s>
<s> Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1 . <\s>
<s> Macrophages also act as scavengers , ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris , and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system . <\s>
<s> Leukocytes act like independent , single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system . <\s>
<s> The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils , and natural killer cells . <\s>
<s> These cells identify and eliminate pathogens , either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms . <\s>
<s> Innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system . <\s>
<s> Dendritic cells are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment ; therefore , they are located mainly in the skin , nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines . <\s>
<s> They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites , as both have many spine-like projections , but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system . <\s>
<s> Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , as they present antigens to T cells , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system . <\s>
<s> Natural killer cells , or NK cells , are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes . <\s>
<s> Rather , NK cells destroy compromised host cells , such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells , recognizing such cells by a condition known as `` missing self . '' <\s>
<s> This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells . <\s>
<s> They were named `` natural killer '' because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are `` missing self . '' <\s>
<s> For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells . <\s>
<s> It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of `` missing self '' . <\s>
<s> Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens . <\s>
<s> Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors which essentially put the brakes on NK cells . <\s>
<s> The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory , where each pathogen is `` remembered '' by a signature antigen . <\s>
<s> The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific `` non-self '' antigens during a process called antigen presentation . <\s>
<s> Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells . <\s>
<s> The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by `` memory cells '' . <\s>
<s> Should a pathogen infect the body more than once , these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it . <\s>
<s> Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets . <\s>
<s> T cells recognize a `` non-self '' target , such as a pathogen , only after antigens have been processed and presented in combination with a `` self '' receptor called a major histocompatibility complex molecule . <\s>
<s> There are two major subtypes of T cells : the killer T cell and the helper T cell . <\s>
<s> In addition there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response . <\s>
<s> Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules , while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules . <\s>
<s> These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell . <\s>
<s> A third , minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors . <\s>
<s> Killer T cells are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional . <\s>
<s> As with B cells , each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen . <\s>
<s> Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell . <\s>
<s> Recognition of this MHC : antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell , called CD8 . <\s>
<s> The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen . <\s>
<s> When an activated T cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter . <\s>
<s> The entry of another toxin called granulysin induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis . <\s>
<s> T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses . <\s>
<s> T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by `` helper '' T cells . <\s>
<s> Helper T cells express T cell receptors that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules . <\s>
<s> The MHC : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's CD4 co-receptor , which recruits molecules inside the T cell that are responsible for the T cell 's activation . <\s>
<s> Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC : antigen complex than observed for killer T cells , meaning many receptors on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC : antigen molecule . <\s>
<s> Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell . <\s>
<s> The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types . <\s>
<s> Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells . <\s>
<s> In addition , helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell 's surface , such as CD40 ligand , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells . <\s>
<s> Gamma delta T cells possess an alternative T cell receptor as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells , cytotoxic T cells and NK cells . <\s>
<s> The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood . <\s>
<s> Like other ' unconventional ' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs , such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells , γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity . <\s>
<s> On one hand , γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system , as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors . <\s>
<s> For example , large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells . <\s>
<s> A B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen . <\s>
<s> This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides . <\s>
<s> The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules . <\s>
<s> This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell , which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell . <\s>
<s> As the activated B cell then begins to divide , its offspring secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen . <\s>
<s> These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph , bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes . <\s>
<s> Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly , by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells . <\s>
<s> When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate , some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells . <\s>
<s> Throughout the lifetime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again . <\s>
<s> This is `` adaptive '' because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges . <\s>
<s> Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory . <\s>
<s> Newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection . <\s>
<s> Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother . <\s>
<s> During pregnancy , a particular type of antibody , called IgG , is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta , so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth , with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother . <\s>
<s> Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies . <\s>
<s> This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies — it only borrows them . <\s>
<s> This passive immunity is usually short-term , lasting from a few days up to several months . <\s>
<s> In medicine , protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum . <\s>
<s> Hormones can act as immunomodulators , altering the sensitivity of the immune system . <\s>
<s> For example , female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses . <\s>
<s> Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially , and their onset often coincides with puberty . <\s>
<s> By contrast , male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive . <\s>
<s> Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well , most notably prolactin , growth hormone and vitamin D . <\s>
<s> When suffering from sleep deprivation , active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production , and a lower immune response , than would be noted in a well-rested individual . <\s>
<s> Additionally , proteins such as NFIL3 , which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms , can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation , shift work , etc . <\s>
<s> As a result , these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease , chronic pain , and asthma . <\s>
<s> It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals . <\s>
<s> Conversely , some hormones are regulated by the immune system , notably thyroid hormone activity . <\s>
<s> The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly . <\s>
<s> As people age , two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels . <\s>
<s> First , they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels . <\s>
<s> This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation . <\s>
<s> Second , as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D . <\s>
<s> The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells . <\s>
<s> Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens . <\s>
<s> This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal . <\s>
<s> NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with tumors . <\s>
<s> Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system . <\s>
<s> Unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant . <\s>
<s> Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs . <\s>
<s> When a part of a plant becomes infected , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant . <\s>
<s> Systemic acquired resistance is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent . <\s>
<s> RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication . <\s>
<s> Overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , particularly the autoimmune disorders . <\s>
<s> Here , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self , and attacks part of the body . <\s>
<s> Under normal circumstances , many T cells and antibodies react with `` self '' peptides . <\s>
<s> One of the functions of specialized cells is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens , preventing autoimmunity . <\s>
<s> Immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive . <\s>
<s> The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence . <\s>
<s> In developed countries , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function . <\s>
<s> However , malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries . <\s>
<s> Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity , complement activity , phagocyte function , IgA antibody concentrations , and cytokine production . <\s>
<s> Additionally , the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection . <\s>
<s> Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells . <\s>
<s> Active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination . <\s>
<s> The principle behind vaccination is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism . <\s>
<s> This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system , as well as its inducibility . <\s>
<s> With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population , vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed . <\s>
<s> The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses . <\s>
<s> Therefore , pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host , while evading detection or destruction by the immune system . <\s>
<s> Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type II secretion system . <\s>
<s> Alternatively , using a type III secretion system , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host . <\s>
<s> These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses . <\s>
<s> In the mid-1950s , Frank Burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory of immunity . <\s>
<s> On the basis of CST , Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction : `` self '' constituents do not trigger destructive immune responses , while `` nonself '' entities trigger a destructive immune response . <\s>
<s> The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex `` two-signal '' activation of T cells . <\s>
<s> The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized , but remain very influential . <\s>
<s> Anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation . <\s>
<s> Glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs ; however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis , and their use must be tightly controlled . <\s>
<s> Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine . <\s>
<s> Cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells . <\s>
<s> However , the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected , which causes toxic side effects . <\s>
<s> Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways . <\s>
<s> In contrast , during wake periods differentiated effector cells , such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs , peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens . <\s>
<s> As well during awake active times , anti-inflammatory molecules , such as cortisol and catecholamines , peak . <\s>
<s> There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time . <\s>
<s> First , inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times . <\s>
<s> Second , inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin . <\s>
<s> Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time . <\s>
<s> When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen , it extends a vitamin D receptor . <\s>
<s> This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D , the steroid hormone calcitriol . <\s>
<s> T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D . <\s>
<s> Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor , in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D , calcitriol , but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1 , which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D , calcidiol into the steroid hormone version , calcitriol . <\s>
<s> Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function . <\s>
<s> Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol , are dendritic cells , keratinocytes and macrophages . <\s>
<s> Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens . <\s>
<s> Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants , and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity . <\s>
<s> The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life . <\s>
<s> Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes , and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses . <\s>
<s> Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates . <\s>
<s> Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system exist only in jawed vertebrates . <\s>
<s> However , a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates , such as the lamprey and hagfish . <\s>
<s> These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors that , like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates , are produced from only a small number of genes . <\s>
<s> These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies , and with the same degree of specificity . <\s>
<s> It is likely that a multicomponent , adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates , as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response . <\s>
<s> Many species , however , utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity . <\s>
<s> Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens , called bacteriophages . <\s>
<s> Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity , through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past , which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference . <\s>
<s> Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes , but studies of their roles in defense are few . <\s>
<s> Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude . <\s>
<s> Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time . <\s>
<s> The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between `` cellular '' and `` humoral '' theories of immunity . <\s>
<s> According to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff , it was cells – more precisely , phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses . <\s>
<s> In contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components found in the organism 's `` humors '' rather than its cells . <\s>
<s> Clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers . <\s>
<s> Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer T cells . <\s>
<s> Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response ; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes . <\s>
<s> In addition , immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens , so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells . <\s>
<s> Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues . <\s>
<s> They are divided into four classes based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction . <\s>
<s> Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy . <\s>
<s> Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death . <\s>
<s> Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen . <\s>
<s> Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction . <\s>
<s> This is also called antibody-dependent hypersensitivity , and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies . <\s>
<s> Immune complexes deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions . <\s>
<s> Type IV hypersensitivity usually takes between two and three days to develop . <\s>
<s> Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases , but may also involve contact dermatitis . <\s>
<s> These reactions are mediated by T cells , monocytes , and macrophages . <\s>
<s> An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host . <\s>
<s> Here , a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells , where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells , antibodies and complement . <\s>
<s> Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria and leishmaniasis . <\s>
<s> Other bacteria , such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement . <\s>
<s> Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host 's immune response . <\s>
<s> Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system . <\s>
<s> Such biofilms are present in many successful infections , e.g. , the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis . <\s>
<s> Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective ; examples include Streptococcus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Peptostreptococcus magnus . <\s>
<s> The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated . <\s>
<s> The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes on the surface of the pathogen , while keeping essential epitopes concealed . <\s>
<s> This is called antigenic variation . <\s>
<s> An example is HIV , which mutates rapidly , so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing . <\s>
<s> These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus . <\s>
<s> The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy , constantly switching one type of surface protein for another , allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response . <\s>
<s> Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system . <\s>
<s> In HIV , the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell ; such `` self-cloaked '' viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as `` non-self '' structures . <\s>
<s> Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors . <\s>
<s> This is called immune surveillance . <\s>
<s> The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells . <\s>
<s> To the immune system , these antigens appear foreign , and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells . <\s>
<s> The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources ; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus , which causes cervical cancer , while others are the organism 's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells . <\s>
<s> One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that , when expressed at high levels , transforms certain skin cells into tumors called melanomas . <\s>
<s> A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival , that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes . <\s>
<s> Larger drugs can provoke a neutralizing immune response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger doses . <\s>
<s> This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins . <\s>
<s> In some cases , the drug itself is not immunogenic , but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound , as is sometimes the case for Taxol . <\s>
<s> Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins , which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies , assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles , and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments . <\s>
<s> Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids ; however , more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes , usually on well-studied virus proteins , as a training set . <\s>
<s> A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells . <\s>
<s> The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics . <\s>
<s> Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins involved in the immune response . <\s>
<s> In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation , sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity . <\s>
<s> First , during the early slow-wave-sleep stage , a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol , epinephrine , and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin . <\s>
<s> These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 , interleukin-12 , TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma . <\s>
<s> These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation , proliferation , and differentiation . <\s>
<s> It is during this time that undifferentiated , or less differentiated , like naïve and central memory T cells , peak . <\s>
<s> In addition to these effects , the milieu of hormones produced at this time support the interactions between APCs and T-cells , a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1 , an increase in overall Th cell proliferation , and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes . <\s>
<s> This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses . <\s>
<s> Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens . <\s>
<s> Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections . <\s>
<s> Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates . <\s>
<s> These mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system . <\s>
<s> Jawed vertebrates , including humans , have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms , including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently . <\s>
<s> Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen . <\s>
<s> This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination . <\s>
<s> In humans , this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes . <\s>
<s> This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response . <\s>
<s> The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules , which are also proteases . <\s>
<s> After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe , they activate their protease activity , which in turn activates other complement proteases , and so on . <\s>
<s> This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback . <\s>
<s> The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells , increase vascular permeability , and opsonize the surface of a pathogen , marking it for destruction . <\s>
<s> This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane . <\s>
<s> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations , set up at the request of member governments . <\s>
<s> It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations , the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme , and later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 43/53 . <\s>
<s> Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP . <\s>
<s> The IPCC produces reports that support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , which is the main international treaty on climate change . <\s>
<s> The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to `` stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system '' . <\s>
<s> IPCC reports cover `` the scientific , technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change , its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation . '' <\s>
<s> Korean economist Hoesung Lee is the chair of the IPCC since October 8 , 2015 , following the election of the new IPCC Bureau . <\s>
<s> Before this election , the IPCC was led by his vice-Chair Ismail El Gizouli , who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of Rajendra K. Pachauri in February 2015 . <\s>
<s> The previous chairs were Rajendra K. Pachauri , elected in May 2002 ; Robert Watson in 1997 ; and Bert Bolin in 1988 . <\s>
<s> The chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs , working group co-chairs , and a secretariat . <\s>
<s> The IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations . <\s>
<s> Participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged . <\s>
<s> Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC Working groups are held at the level of government representatives . <\s>
<s> Non Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers . <\s>
<s> Sessions of the IPCC Bureau , workshops , expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only . <\s>
<s> Attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts . <\s>
<s> After the opening ceremonies , closed plenary sessions were held . <\s>
<s> The meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at Sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations . <\s>
<s> The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund , established in 1989 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization , Costs of the Secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO , while UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary . <\s>
<s> Annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO , by UNEP , and by IPCC Members ; the scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel , which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget . <\s>
<s> The organisation is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO . <\s>
<s> The IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data . <\s>
<s> Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources . <\s>
<s> According to IPCC guidelines , authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources . <\s>
<s> Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources , provided that they are of sufficient quality . <\s>
<s> Examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results , reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations , and industry journals . <\s>
<s> Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required . <\s>
<s> Each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material . <\s>
<s> A chapter typically has two `` coordinating lead authors '' , ten to fifteen `` lead authors '' , and a somewhat larger number of `` contributing authors '' . <\s>
<s> The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors , ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements , and reporting to the Working Group chairs . <\s>
<s> Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters . <\s>
<s> Contributing authors prepare text , graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors . <\s>
<s> The executive summary of the WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases , resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth 's surface . <\s>
<s> They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect . <\s>
<s> They predict that under a `` business as usual '' scenario , global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °C per decade during the century . <\s>
<s> They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years , broadly consistent with prediction of climate models , but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability . <\s>
<s> The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more . <\s>
<s> In 2001 , 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change . <\s>
<s> The joint statement was made by the Australian Academy of Science , the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts , the Brazilian Academy of Sciences , the Royal Society of Canada , the Caribbean Academy of Sciences , the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the French Academy of Sciences , the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina , the Indian National Science Academy , the Indonesian Academy of Sciences , the Royal Irish Academy , Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei , the Academy of Sciences Malaysia , the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and the Royal Society . <\s>
<s> The statement , also published as an editorial in the journal Science , stated `` we support the conclusion that it is at least 90 % certain that temperatures will continue to rise , with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels by 2100 '' . <\s>
<s> The TAR has also been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences , Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society , and European Geosciences Union . <\s>
<s> IPCC author Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the TAR . <\s>
<s> Among his criticisms , Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report . <\s>
<s> For example , Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models . <\s>
<s> John Houghton , who was a co-chair of TAR WGI , has responded to Lindzen 's criticisms of the SPM . <\s>
<s> Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world 's governments , and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence . <\s>
<s> In addition to climate assessment reports , the IPCC is publishing Special Reports on specific topics . <\s>
<s> The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports . <\s>
<s> In the year 2011 two IPCC Special Report were finalized , the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation and the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation . <\s>
<s> Both Special Reports were requested by governments . <\s>
<s> The IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process . <\s>
<s> While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function , it also supports other activities , such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme , required under the UNFCCC . <\s>
<s> This involves publishing default emission factors , which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption , industrial production and so on . <\s>
<s> This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers . <\s>
<s> The IPCC has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect , while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust . <\s>
<s> They expressed regret for `` the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance '' . <\s>
<s> The date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the IPCC from the WWF report , which has misquoted its own source , an ICSI report `` Variations of Snow and Ice in the past and at present on a Global and Regional Scale '' . <\s>
<s> Former IPCC chairman Robert Watson has said `` The mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact '' . <\s>
<s> That is worrying . <\s>
<s> The IPCC needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened . <\s>
<s> Martin Parry , a climate expert who had been co-chair of the IPCC working group II , said that `` What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance '' and the IPCC had investigated the other alleged mistakes , which were `` generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment '' . <\s>
<s> The third assessment report prominently featured a graph labeled `` Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction '' based on a 1999 paper by Michael E. Mann , Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes , which has been referred to as the `` hockey stick graph '' . <\s>
<s> This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995 , and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units , but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years , and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century . <\s>
<s> The schematic was not an actual plot of data , and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England , with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England . <\s>
<s> Even with this increase , the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007 . <\s>
<s> The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al. 1998 , Pollack , Huang & Shen 1998 , Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000 , using differing data and methods . <\s>
<s> The Jones et al. and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 2.21 of the IPCC report . <\s>
<s> These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900 , and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity . <\s>
<s> Even at the draft stage , this finding was disputed by contrarians : in May 2000 Fred Singer 's Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill , Washington , D.C. , featuring comments on the graph Wibjörn Karlén and Singer argued against the graph at a United States Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation hearing on 18 July 2000 . <\s>
<s> Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic , which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report , and argued that `` Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report , the IPCC presented the ' Hockey Stick ' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report '' . <\s>
<s> Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper , which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy , was picked up by the Bush administration , and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that `` manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people '' . <\s>
<s> The data and methodology used to produce the `` hockey stick graph '' was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick , and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007 , which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick . <\s>
<s> On 23 June 2005 , Rep. Joe Barton , chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield , Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demanding full records on climate research , as well as personal information about their finances and careers , from Mann , Bradley and Hughes . <\s>
<s> Sherwood Boehlert , chairman of the House Science Committee , said this was a `` misguided and illegitimate investigation '' apparently aimed at intimidating scientists , and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation . <\s>
<s> The National Research Council 's report agreed that there were some statistical failings , but these had little effect on the graph , which was generally correct . <\s>
<s> In a 2006 letter to Nature , Mann , Bradley , and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that `` more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached '' and that the uncertainties were `` the point of the article '' . <\s>
<s> The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007 featured a graph showing 12 proxy based temperature reconstructions , including the three highlighted in the 2001 Third Assessment Report ; Mann , Bradley & Hughes 1999 as before , Jones et al. 1998 and Briffa 2000 had both been calibrated by newer studies . <\s>
<s> In addition , analysis of the Medieval Warm Period cited reconstructions by Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Osborn & Briffa 2006 . <\s>
<s> Ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1,000 years or longer . <\s>
<s> Most reconstructions shared some data series , particularly tree ring data , but newer reconstructions used additional data and covered a wider area , using a variety of statistical methods . <\s>
<s> The section discussed the divergence problem affecting certain tree ring data . <\s>
<s> On 1 February 2007 , the eve of the publication of IPCC 's major report on climate , a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001 . <\s>
<s> The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations . <\s>
<s> Over the six years studied , the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC 's 2001 projection , and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection . <\s>
<s> Another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC , far from overstating dangers and risks , have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels . <\s>
<s> When the researchers ' analysis was `` applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m above 1990 levels '' . <\s>
<s> These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report , published in 2001 . <\s>
<s> This may have been due , in part , to the expanding human understanding of climate . <\s>
<s> Michael Oppenheimer , a long-time participant in the IPCC and coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report conceded in Science Magazine 's State of the Planet 2008-2009 some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring , smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous IPCC assessment reports . <\s>
<s> It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties . <\s>
<s> Others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the IPCC process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties . <\s>
<s> The IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges . <\s>
<s> In case of the Ozone depletion global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful , in case of Climate Change , the Kyoto Protocol failed . <\s>
<s> The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process . <\s>
<s> The lockstep situation of the IPCC is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different , if not opposing goals . <\s>
<s> The underlying linear model of policy-making of more knowledge we have , the better the political response will be is being doubted . <\s>
<s> According to Sheldon Ungar 's comparison with global warming , the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties . <\s>
<s> The ozone case communicated to lay persons `` with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture '' and related to `` immediate risks with everyday relevance '' , while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger . <\s>
<s> The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts . <\s>
<s> In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol , varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem . <\s>
<s> In the UK , a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change . <\s>
<s> Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research , it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies , and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report 's final release . <\s>
<s> In principle , this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report can not be included . <\s>
<s> In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing , this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science . <\s>
<s> However , there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next . <\s>
<s> In February 2010 , in response to controversies regarding claims in the Fourth Assessment Report , five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC . <\s>
<s> They suggested a range of new organizational options , from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors , to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body , or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated `` living '' Wikipedia-IPCC . <\s>
<s> Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference . <\s>
<s> A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself . <\s>
<s> A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number . <\s>
<s> For example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 . <\s>
<s> The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . <\s>
<s> The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e.g. , 3 , 1 · 3 , 1 · 1 · 3 , etc. are all valid factorizations of 3 . <\s>
<s> The property of being prime is called primality . <\s>
<s> A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division . <\s>
<s> It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . <\s>
<s> Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers . <\s>
<s> These include the Miller–Rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small probability of error , and the AKS primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical . <\s>
<s> Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms , such as Mersenne numbers . <\s>
<s> As of January 2016 , the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits . <\s>
<s> There are infinitely many primes , as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC . <\s>
<s> There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers . <\s>
<s> However , the distribution of primes , that is to say , the statistical behaviour of primes in the large , can be modelled . <\s>
<s> The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem , proven at the end of the 19th century , which says that the probability that a given , randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits , or to the logarithm of n . <\s>
<s> Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , such as Goldbach 's conjecture , and the twin prime conjecture . <\s>
<s> Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers . <\s>
<s> Primes are used in several routines in information technology , such as public-key cryptography , which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors . <\s>
<s> Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains , mainly algebra , such as prime elements and prime ideals . <\s>
<s> Hence , 6 is not prime . <\s>
<s> The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime : 12 = 3 · 4 . <\s>
<s> No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition , any such number n has at least three distinct divisors , namely 1 , 2 , and n . <\s>
<s> This implies that n is not prime . <\s>
<s> Accordingly , the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2 . <\s>
<s> Similarly , when written in the usual decimal system , all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5 . <\s>
<s> Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number , so they could not consider it to be a prime . <\s>
<s> By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number . <\s>
<s> In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree . <\s>
<s> In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime . <\s>
<s> For example , Derrick Norman Lehmer 's list of primes up to 10,006,721 , reprinted as late as 1956 , started with 1 as its first prime . <\s>
<s> Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime . <\s>
<s> By the early 20th century , mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number , but rather forms its own special category as a `` unit '' . <\s>
<s> A large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime , but Euclid 's fundamental theorem of arithmetic would not hold as stated . <\s>
<s> For example , the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5 ; if 1 were admitted as a prime , these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers , so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified . <\s>
<s> Similarly , the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime : a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 and produce as output only the single number 1 . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks , such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler 's totient function or the sum of divisors function . <\s>
<s> There are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers : the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus , for instance , have quite different forms for primes and for composites . <\s>
<s> However , the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks . <\s>
<s> Euclid 's Elements contain important theorems about primes , including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . <\s>
<s> Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime . <\s>
<s> The Sieve of Eratosthenes , attributed to Eratosthenes , is a simple method to compute primes , although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way . <\s>
<s> After the Greeks , little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century . <\s>
<s> In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated Fermat 's little theorem . <\s>
<s> Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime and he verified this up to n = 4 . <\s>
<s> However , the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite , as Euler discovered later , and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime . <\s>
<s> The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1 , with p a prime . <\s>
<s> They are called Mersenne primes in his honor . <\s>
<s> The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division . <\s>
<s> This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n . <\s>
<s> If the result of any of these divisions is an integer , then n is not a prime , otherwise it is a prime . <\s>
<s> Indeed , if is composite then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most . <\s>
<s> For example , for , the trial divisions are by m = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 . <\s>
<s> None of these numbers divides 37 , so 37 is prime . <\s>
<s> This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known — then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime . <\s>
<s> For example , to check the primality of 37 , only three divisions are necessary , given that 4 and 6 are composite . <\s>
<s> Modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes , probabilistic and deterministic algorithms . <\s>
<s> Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not . <\s>
<s> For example , trial division is a deterministic algorithm because , if performed correctly , it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite . <\s>
<s> Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster , but do not completely prove that a number is prime . <\s>
<s> These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way . <\s>
<s> For example , a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number , but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number . <\s>
<s> If we repeat the test n times and pass every time , then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n , which decreases exponentially with the number of tests , so we can be as sure as we like that the number is prime . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if the test ever fails , then we know that the number is composite . <\s>
<s> A particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test , which relies on the fact that np≡n for any n if p is a prime number . <\s>
<s> If we have a number b that we want to test for primality , then we work out nb for a random value of n as our test . <\s>
<s> A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime , so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers . <\s>
<s> Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers , though , so this test can be useful for practical purposes . <\s>
<s> More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test , such as the Baillie-PSW , Miller-Rabin , and Solovay-Strassen tests , are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number . <\s>
<s> Are prime . <\s>
<s> Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes . <\s>
<s> Other primes where either p + 1 or p − 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes , primorial primes , Fermat primes and Mersenne primes , that is , prime numbers that are of the form 2p − 1 , where p is an arbitrary prime . <\s>
<s> The Lucas–Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form . <\s>
<s> This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers . <\s>
<s> The following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types . <\s>
<s> Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing . <\s>
<s> In 2009 , the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US $ 100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits . <\s>
<s> The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $ 150,000 and $ 250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits , respectively . <\s>
<s> Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data , converting it to a number n , multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k , and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1 , 256k(n + 1) − 1] . <\s>
<s> Are prime for any natural number n . <\s>
<s> Here represents the floor function , i.e. , largest integer not greater than the number in question . <\s>
<s> The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand 's postulate , which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2 , for any natural number n > 3 . <\s>
<s> However , computing A or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with . <\s>
<s> Another formula is based on Wilson 's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once . <\s>
<s> Can have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime , i.e. , their greatest common divisor is one . <\s>
<s> If this necessary condition is satisfied , Dirichlet 's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes . <\s>
<s> The picture below illustrates this with q = 9 : the numbers are `` wrapped around '' as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed . <\s>
<s> Primes are highlighted in red . <\s>
<s> The rows starting with a = 3 , 6 , or 9 contain at most one prime number . <\s>
<s> In all other rows there are infinitely many prime numbers . <\s>
<s> What is more , the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run — the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6 . <\s>
<s> The zeta function is closely related to prime numbers . <\s>
<s> For example , the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function : if there were only finitely many primes then ζ would have a finite value . <\s>
<s> However , the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges , so there must be infinitely many primes . <\s>
<s> Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity , due to Euler . <\s>
<s> The unproven Riemann hypothesis , dating from 1859 , states that except for s = −2 , −4 , ... , all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2 . <\s>
<s> The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible . <\s>
<s> From a physical viewpoint , it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise . <\s>
<s> From a mathematical viewpoint , it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x . <\s>
<s> This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct . <\s>
<s> In particular , the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason . <\s>
<s> In addition to the Riemann hypothesis , many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed . <\s>
<s> Often having an elementary formulation , many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades : all four of Landau 's problems from 1912 are still unsolved . <\s>
<s> One of them is Goldbach 's conjecture , which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes . <\s>
<s> As of February 2011 , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017 . <\s>
<s> Weaker statements than this have been proven , for example Vinogradov 's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes . <\s>
<s> Chen 's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime , the product of two primes . <\s>
<s> Also , any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes . <\s>
<s> The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory . <\s>
<s> A third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes . <\s>
<s> It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes , pairs of primes with difference 2 . <\s>
<s> Polignac 's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture , it states that for every positive integer n , there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n . <\s>
<s> It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1 . <\s>
<s> These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel 's hypothesis H . <\s>
<s> Brocard 's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2 . <\s>
<s> Legendre 's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n . <\s>
<s> It is implied by the stronger Cramér 's conjecture . <\s>
<s> Giuga 's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime . <\s>
<s> Another consequence of Fermat 's little theorem is the following : if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5 , 1/p is always a recurring decimal , whose period is p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1 . <\s>
<s> The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q has similar effect , provided that p is not a prime factor of q . <\s>
<s> Wilson 's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p − 1)! + 1 is divisible by p . <\s>
<s> Moreover , an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n − 1)! is divisible by n . <\s>
<s> Several public-key cryptography algorithms , such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange , are based on large prime numbers . <\s>
<s> RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier to perform the multiplication of two numbers x and y than to calculate x and y if only the product xy is known . <\s>
<s> The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation , while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem . <\s>
<s> The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers . <\s>
<s> These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground . <\s>
<s> They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7 , 13 or 17 years , at which point they fly about , breed , and then die after a few weeks at most . <\s>
<s> The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas . <\s>
<s> If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals , say every 12 years , then predators appearing every 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , or 12 years would be sure to meet them . <\s>
<s> Over a 200-year period , average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2 % higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas . <\s>
<s> Though small , this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects . <\s>
<s> The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics . <\s>
<s> Generally , `` prime '' indicates minimality or indecomposability , in an appropriate sense . <\s>
<s> For example , the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1 . <\s>
<s> It is either Q or the finite field with p elements , whence the name . <\s>
<s> Often a second , additional meaning is intended by using the word prime , namely that any object can be , essentially uniquely , decomposed into its prime components . <\s>
<s> For example , in knot theory , a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it can not be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots . <\s>
<s> Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots . <\s>
<s> Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type . <\s>
<s> Prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R , an algebraic structure where addition , subtraction and multiplication are defined : prime elements and irreducible elements . <\s>
<s> An element p of R is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit and satisfies the following requirement : given x and y in R such that p divides the product xy , then p divides x or y . <\s>
<s> An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and can not be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units . <\s>
<s> In the ring Z of integers , the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements , which is <\s>
<s> The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains . <\s>
<s> An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z , that is , the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers . <\s>
<s> Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes . <\s>
<s> Not every prime is a Gaussian prime : in the bigger ring Z , 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes and . Rational primes of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes , whereas rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not . <\s>
<s> In ring theory , the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal . <\s>
<s> Prime ideals , which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal , are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra , algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry . <\s>
<s> The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals , , , , , , … <\s>
<s> The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker–Noether theorem , which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals , which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers . <\s>
<s> Prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects , via the notion of the spectrum of a ring . <\s>
<s> Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion , and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory . <\s>
<s> For example , factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field , a basic problem of algebraic number theory , bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry . <\s>
<s> Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers . <\s>
<s> For example , prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity , a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations <\s>
<s> In particular , this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p , in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value . <\s>
<s> While completing Q with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers , completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers . <\s>
<s> These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q , by Ostrowski 's theorem . <\s>
<s> Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed fields . <\s>
<s> This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory . <\s>
<s> Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers . <\s>
<s> The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through `` natural phenomena '' . <\s>
<s> In works such as La Nativité du Seigneur and Quatre études de rythme , he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms : the primes 41 , 43 , 47 and 53 appear in the third étude , `` Neumes rythmiques '' . <\s>
<s> According to Messiaen this way of composing was `` inspired by the movements of nature , movements of free and unequal durations '' . <\s>
<s> The Rhine is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps , forms part of the Swiss-Austrian , Swiss-Liechtenstein border , Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border , then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands . <\s>
<s> The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne , Germany with a population of more than 1,050,000 people . <\s>
<s> It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe , at about 1,230 km , with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s . <\s>
<s> The variant forms of the name of the Rhine in modern languages are all derived from the Gaulish name Rēnos , which was adapted in Roman-era geography as Greek Ῥῆνος , Latin Rhenus . <\s>
<s> The spelling with Rh- in English Rhine as well as in German Rhein and French Rhin is due to the influence of Greek orthography , while the vocalisation -i- is due to the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as * Rīnaz , via Old Frankish giving Old English Rín , Old High German Rīn , Dutch Rijn . <\s>
<s> The diphthong in modern German Rhein is a Central German development of the early modern period , the Alemannic name Rī(n) retaining the older vocalism , as does Ripuarian Rhing , while Palatine has diphthongized Rhei , Rhoi . <\s>
<s> Spanish is with French in adopting the Germanic vocalism Rin- , while Italian , Occitan and Portuguese retain the Latin Ren- . <\s>
<s> The length of the Rhine is conventionally measured in `` Rhine-kilometers '' , a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the Old Rhine Bridge at Constance to Hoek van Holland . <\s>
<s> The river length is significantly shortened from the river 's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century . <\s>
<s> The `` total length of the Rhine '' , to the inclusion of Lake Constance and the Alpine Rhine is more difficult to measure objectively ; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres by the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat in 2010 . <\s>
<s> Near Tamins-Reichenau the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Rhine . <\s>
<s> The river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur . <\s>
<s> This section is nearly 86 km long , and descends from a height of 599 m to 396 m . <\s>
<s> It flows through a wide glacial alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley . <\s>
<s> Near Sargans a natural dam , only a few metres high , prevents it from flowing into the open Seeztal valley and then through Lake Walen and Lake Zurich into the river Aare . <\s>
<s> The Alpine Rhine begins in the most western part of the Swiss canton of Graubünden , and later forms the border between Switzerland to the West and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the East . <\s>
<s> The mouth of the Rhine into Lake Constance forms an inland delta . <\s>
<s> The delta is delimited in the West by the Alter Rhein and in the East by a modern canalized section . <\s>
<s> Most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary . <\s>
<s> It includes the Austrian towns of Gaißau , Höchst and Fußach . <\s>
<s> The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments . <\s>
<s> In the local Alemannic dialect , the singular is pronounced `` Isel '' and this is also the local pronunciation of Esel . <\s>
<s> Many local fields have an official name containing this element . <\s>
<s> A regulation of the Rhine was called for , with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fußach , in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta . <\s>
<s> The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted , too , and it now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake . <\s>
<s> Its water has a darker color than the Rhine ; the latter 's lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains . <\s>
<s> It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake . <\s>
<s> This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee . <\s>
<s> Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water : the Obersee , the Untersee , and a connecting stretch of the Rhine , called the Seerhein . <\s>
<s> The lake is situated in Germany , Switzerland and Austria near the Alps . <\s>
<s> Specifically , its shorelines lie in the German states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg , the Austrian state of Vorarlberg , and the Swiss cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen . <\s>
<s> The Rhine flows into it from the south following the Swiss-Austrian border . <\s>
<s> It is located at approximately 47 ° 39 ' N 9 ° 19 ' E﻿/ 47.650 ° N 9.317 ° E / 47.650 ; 9.317 . <\s>
<s> The flow of cold , gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake . <\s>
<s> The cold water flows near the surface and at first does n't mix with the warmer , green waters of Upper Lake . <\s>
<s> But then , at the so-called Rheinbrech , the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water . <\s>
<s> The flow reappears on the surface at the northern shore of the lake , off the island of Lindau . <\s>
<s> The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee . <\s>
<s> A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake Überlingen . <\s>
<s> Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper into the Rheinrinne and Seerhein . <\s>
<s> Depending on the water level , this flow of the Rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake . <\s>
<s> The Rhine emerges from Lake Constance , flows generally westward , as the Hochrhein , passes the Rhine Falls , and is joined by its major tributary , the river Aare . <\s>
<s> The Aare more than doubles the Rhine 's water discharge , to an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s , and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border . <\s>
<s> The Aare also contains the waters from the 4,274 m summit of Finsteraarhorn , the highest point of the Rhine basin . <\s>
<s> The Rhine roughly forms the German-Swiss border from Lake Constance with the exceptions of the canton of Schaffhausen and parts of the cantons of Zürich and Basel-Stadt , until it turns north at the so-called Rhine knee at Basel , leaving Switzerland . <\s>
<s> In the centre of Basel , the first major city in the course of the stream , is located the `` Rhine knee '' ; this is a major bend , where the overall direction of the Rhine changes from West to North . <\s>
<s> Here the High Rhine ends . <\s>
<s> Legally , the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine . <\s>
<s> The river now flows North as Upper Rhine through the Upper Rhine Plain , which is about 300 km long and up to 40 km wide . <\s>
<s> The most important tributaries in this area are the Ill below of Strasbourg , the Neckar in Mannheim and the Main across from Mainz . <\s>
<s> In Mainz , the Rhine leaves the Upper Rhine Valley and flows through the Mainz Basin . <\s>
<s> The Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by a Rhine straightening program in the 19th Century . <\s>
<s> The rate of flow was increased and the ground water level fell significantly . <\s>
<s> Dead branches dried up and the amount of forests on the flood plains decreased sharply . <\s>
<s> On the French side , the Grand Canal d ' Alsace was dug , which carries a significant part of the river water , and all of the traffic . <\s>
<s> In some places , there are large compensation pools , for example the huge Bassin de compensation de Plobsheim in Alsace . <\s>
<s> The Rhine is the longest river in Germany . <\s>
<s> It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries , such as the Neckar , the Main and , later , the Moselle , which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s . <\s>
<s> Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle ; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands . <\s>
<s> Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle . <\s>
<s> As it approaches the Dutch border , the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of 2,290 m3/s and an average width of 400 m . <\s>
<s> Between Bingen and Bonn , the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine Gorge , a formation which was created by erosion . <\s>
<s> The rate of erosion equaled the uplift in the region , such that the river was left at about its original level while the surrounding lands raised . <\s>
<s> The gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river which is known for its many castles and vineyards . <\s>
<s> It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and known as `` the Romantic Rhine '' , with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the Middle Ages and many quaint and lovely country villages . <\s>
<s> Until the early 1980s , industry was a major source of water pollution . <\s>
<s> Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland , it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated , as the river passes the major cities of Cologne , Düsseldorf and Duisburg . <\s>
<s> Duisburg is the home of Europe 's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam , Antwerp and Amsterdam . <\s>
<s> The Ruhr , which joins the Rhine in Duisburg , is nowadays a clean river , thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls , a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures , such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields . <\s>
<s> The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water . <\s>
<s> It contributes 70 m3/s to the Rhine . <\s>
<s> Other rivers in the Ruhr Area , above all , the Emscher , still carry a considerable degree of pollution . <\s>
<s> The dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism . <\s>
<s> The Rhine Gorge between Rüdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . <\s>
<s> Near Sankt Goarshausen , the Rhine flows around the famous rock Lorelei . <\s>
<s> With its outstanding architectural monuments , the slopes full of vines , settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes , the Middle Rhine Valley can be considered the epitome of the Rhine romanticism . <\s>
<s> The Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia . <\s>
<s> Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized , in particular the agglomerations Cologne , Düsseldorf and Ruhr area . <\s>
<s> Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany , the Rhine-Ruhr region . <\s>
<s> One of the most important cities in this region is Duisburg with the largest river port in Europe . <\s>
<s> The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural . <\s>
<s> In Wesel , 30 km downstream of Duisburg , is located the western end of the second east-west shipping route , the Wesel-Datteln Canal , which runs parallel to the Lippe . <\s>
<s> Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge , the longest suspension bridge in Germany , crosses the 400 m wide river . <\s>
<s> Near Krefeld , the river crosses the Uerdingen line , the line which separates the areas where Low German and High German are spoken . <\s>
<s> From here , the situation becomes more complicated , as the Dutch name Rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water . <\s>
<s> Two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west , through the Waal and then , via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede , merging with the Meuse , through the Hollands Diep and Haringvliet estuaries , into the North Sea . <\s>
<s> The Beneden Merwede branches off , near Hardinxveld-Giessendam and continues as the Noord , to join the Lek , near the village of Kinderdijk , to form the Nieuwe Maas ; then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg , to the North Sea . <\s>
<s> The Oude Maas branches off , near Dordrecht , farther down rejoining the Nieuwe Maas to form Het Scheur . <\s>
<s> The other third of the water flows through the Pannerdens Kanaal and redistributes in the IJssel and Nederrijn . <\s>
<s> The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the Rhine north into the IJsselmeer , while the Nederrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal . <\s>
<s> However , at Wijk bij Duurstede , the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek . <\s>
<s> It flows farther west , to rejoin the Noord River into the Nieuwe Maas and to the North Sea . <\s>
<s> The name Rijn , from here on , is used only for smaller streams farther to the north , which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times . <\s>
<s> Though they retained the name , these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine , but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders . <\s>
<s> From Wijk bij Duurstede , the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn past Utrecht , first Leidse Rijn and then , Oude Rijn . <\s>
<s> The latter flows west into a sluice at Katwijk , where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea . <\s>
<s> This branch once formed the line along which the Limes Germanicus were built . <\s>
<s> During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages , the Rhine took a left turn , creating the Channel River , the course of which now lies below the English Channel . <\s>
<s> The Rhine-Meuse Delta , the most important natural region of the Netherlands begins near Millingen aan de Rijn , close to the Dutch-German border with the division of the Rhine into Waal and Nederrijn . <\s>
<s> Since the Rhine contributes most of the water , the shorter term Rhine Delta is commonly used . <\s>
<s> However , this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance , so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta , or even Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta , as the Scheldt ends in the same delta . <\s>
<s> The shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations : first , at Millingen aan de Rijn , the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal , which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren , and second near Arnhem , the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn . <\s>
<s> This creates three main flows , two of which change names rather often . <\s>
<s> The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede , Beneden Merwede , Noord River , Nieuwe Maas , Het Scheur and Nieuwe Waterweg . <\s>
<s> The middle flow begins as Nederrijn , then changes into Lek , then joins the Noord , thereby forming Nieuwe Maas . <\s>
<s> The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer . <\s>
<s> Three more flows carry significant amounts of water : the Nieuwe Merwede , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede ; the Oude Maas , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord , and Dordtse Kil , which branches off from Oude Maas . <\s>
<s> Before the St. Elizabeth 's flood , the Meuse flowed just south of today 's line Merwede-Oude Maas to the North Sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with Waal and Lek . <\s>
<s> This system of numerous bays , estuary-like extended rivers , many islands and constant changes of the coastline , is hard to imagine today . <\s>
<s> From 1421 to 1904 , the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form Merwede . <\s>
<s> For flood protection reasons , the Meuse was separated from the Waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called `` Bergse Maas '' , then Amer and then flows into the former bay Hollands Diep . <\s>
<s> The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta 's main arms , disconnected arms and smaller rivers and streams . <\s>
<s> Many rivers have been closed and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders . <\s>
<s> The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century fundamentally . <\s>
<s> Currently Rhine water runs into the sea , or into former marine bays now separated from the sea , in five places , namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede , Nieuwe Waterway , Dordtse Kil , Spui and IJssel . <\s>
<s> The Rhine-Meuse Delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents . <\s>
<s> This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea . <\s>
<s> Before the construction of the Delta Works , tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen , and even today , after the regulatory action of the Delta Works , the tide acts far inland . <\s>
<s> At the Waal , for example , the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel . <\s>
<s> In southern Europe , the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era , with the opening of the Tethys Ocean , between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates , between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP . <\s>
<s> The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea . <\s>
<s> At about 180 MBP , in the Jurassic Period , the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor , causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods . <\s>
<s> Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography : Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees ; Italy , the Alps , and Anatolia , moving west , the mountains of Greece and the islands . <\s>
<s> The compression and orogeny continue today , as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes . <\s>
<s> From the Eocene onwards , the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a N–S rift system to develop in this zone . <\s>
<s> The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben , in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment , in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands . <\s>
<s> By the time of the Miocene , a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben , that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river . <\s>
<s> At that time , it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps ; instead , the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps . <\s>
<s> Through stream capture , the Rhine extended its watershed southward . <\s>
<s> By the Pliocene period , the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains , including the Mosel , the Main and the Neckar . <\s>
<s> The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone . <\s>
<s> By the early Pleistocene period , the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rhône , including the Aar . <\s>
<s> Since that time , the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance , the upper reaches of the Main , beyond Schweinfurt and the Vosges Mountains , captured from the Meuse , to its watershed . <\s>
<s> Around 2.5 million years ago was the geological period of the Ice Ages . <\s>
<s> Since approximately 600,000 years ago , six major Ice Ages have occurred , in which sea level dropped 120 m and much of the continental margins became exposed . <\s>
<s> In the Early Pleistocene , the Rhine followed a course to the northwest , through the present North Sea . <\s>
<s> During the so-called Anglian glaciation , the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed , that overflowed through the English Channel . <\s>
<s> This caused the Rhine 's course to be diverted through the English Channel . <\s>
<s> Since then , during glacial times , the river mouth was located offshore of Brest , France and rivers , like the Thames and the Seine , became tributaries to the Rhine . <\s>
<s> During interglacials , when sea level rose to approximately the present level , the Rhine built deltas , in what is now the Netherlands . <\s>
<s> The last glacial ran from ~74,000 , until the end of the Pleistocene . <\s>
<s> In northwest Europe , it saw two very cold phases , peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000–24,000 BP . <\s>
<s> The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum . <\s>
<s> During this time , the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest , through the English Channel and finally , to the Atlantic Ocean . <\s>
<s> The English Channel , the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land , mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m lower than today . <\s>
<s> Most of the Rhine 's current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age ; although , its source must still have been a glacier . <\s>
<s> A tundra , with Ice Age flora and fauna , stretched across middle Europe , from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean . <\s>
<s> Such was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum , ca. 22,000–14,000 yr BP , when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia , the Baltics , Scotland and the Alps , but left the space between as open tundra . <\s>
<s> The loess or wind-blown dust over that tundra , settled in and around the Rhine Valley , contributing to its current agricultural usefulness . <\s>
<s> As northwest Europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring . <\s>
<s> Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension . <\s>
<s> Rapid warming and changes of vegetation , to open forest , began about 13,000 BP . <\s>
<s> By 9000 BP , Europe was fully forested . <\s>
<s> With globally shrinking ice-cover , ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated . <\s>
<s> Meltwater , adding to the ocean and land subsidence , drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally . <\s>
<s> Since 7500 yr ago , a situation with tides and currents , very similar to present has existed . <\s>
<s> Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far , that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together , could compensate the transgression by the sea ; in the last 7000 years , the coast line was roughly at the same location . <\s>
<s> In the southern North Sea , due to ongoing tectonic subsidence , the sea level is still rising , at the rate of about 1–3 cm per century . <\s>
<s> At the begin of the Holocene , the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley . <\s>
<s> As a meandering river , it reworked its ice-age braidplain . <\s>
<s> As sea-level continued to rise in the Netherlands , the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began . <\s>
<s> Coeval absolute sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution . <\s>
<s> Other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault , the substrate and geomorphology , as inherited from the Last Glacial and the coastal-marine dynamics , such as barrier and tidal inlet formations . <\s>
<s> Since ~3000 yr BP , human impact is seen in the delta . <\s>
<s> As a result of increasing land clearance , in the upland areas , the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up . <\s>
<s> This caused increased flooding and sedimentation , ending peat formation in the delta . <\s>
<s> The shifting of river channels to new locations , on the floodplain , was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta . <\s>
<s> Over the past 6000 years , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred . <\s>
<s> Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining , for salt and fuel , from Roman times onward . <\s>
<s> This was followed by embankment , of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries , which took place in the 11–13th century AD . <\s>
<s> Thereafter , canals were dug , bends were short cut and groynes were built , to prevent the river 's channels from migrating or silting up . <\s>
<s> At present , the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea , through the former Meuse estuary , near Rotterdam . <\s>
<s> The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer , formerly the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon ; however , since 1932 , a freshwater lake . <\s>
<s> The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches : the River Waal , the River Nederrijn – Lek and the River IJssel . <\s>
<s> This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709 , by river engineering works , including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century , with the help of weirs in the Nederrijn river . <\s>
<s> The Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Roman-era geography . <\s>
<s> At that time , it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania . <\s>
<s> The Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC , and by the 1st century BC , the areal of the La Tène culture covered almost its entire length , forming a contact zone with the Jastorf culture , i.e. the locus of early Celtic-Germanic cultural contact . <\s>
<s> In Roman geography , the Rhine formed the boundary between Gallia and Germania by definition ; e.g. Maurus Servius Honoratus , Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil fluvius Galliae , qui Germanos a Gallia dividit `` river of Gaul , which divides the Germanic people from Gaul . '' <\s>
<s> From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70 , Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube . <\s>
<s> Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt , opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum , the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads . <\s>
<s> The northern section of this frontier , where the Rhine is deep and broad , remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell . <\s>
<s> The southern part was different . <\s>
<s> The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed . <\s>
<s> The frontier which they form is inconveniently long , enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg . <\s>
<s> The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty , and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards . <\s>
<s> The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine . <\s>
<s> The actual number of legions present at any base or in all , depended on whether a state or threat of war existed . <\s>
<s> Between about AD 14 and 180 , the assignment of legions was as follows : for the army of Germania Inferior , two legions at Vetera , I Germanica and XX Valeria ; two legions at oppidum Ubiorum , which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina , descending to Cologne , V Alaudae , a Celtic legion recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and XXI , possibly a Galatian legion from the other side of the empire . <\s>
<s> Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period , by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine , Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine . <\s>
<s> This `` Germanic Heroic Age '' is reflected in medieval legend , such as the Nibelungenlied which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels , near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms , at the Rhine and Kriemhild 's golden treasure , which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen . <\s>
<s> By the 6th century , the Rhine was within the borders of Francia . <\s>
<s> In the 9th , it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia , but in the 10th century , it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire , flowing through Swabia , Franconia and Lower Lorraine . <\s>
<s> The mouths of the Rhine , in the county of Holland , fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century ; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states . <\s>
<s> The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years ' War . <\s>
<s> The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route . <\s>
<s> Since the Peace of Westphalia , the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany . <\s>
<s> Establishing `` natural borders '' on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy , since the Middle Ages , though the language border was – and is – far more to the west . <\s>
<s> French leaders , such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte , tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine . <\s>
<s> The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon , as a French client state , in 1806 and lasted until 1814 , during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire . <\s>
<s> In 1840 , the Rhine crisis , prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers 's desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border , led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany . <\s>
<s> At the end of World War I , the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles . <\s>
<s> This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies , until 1935 and after that , it would be a demilitarised zone , with the German army forbidden to enter . <\s>
<s> The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision , in general , caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitler 's rise to power . <\s>
<s> The allies left the Rhineland , in 1930 and the German army re-occupied it in 1936 , which was enormously popular in Germany . <\s>
<s> Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation , Britain and France were not inclined to do so , a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler . <\s>
<s> In World War II , it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany , by the Western Allies . <\s>
<s> The Rhine bridge at Arnhem , immortalized in the book , A Bridge Too Far and the film , was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem , during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944 . <\s>
<s> The bridges at Nijmegen , over the Waal distributary of the Rhine , were also an objective of Operation Market Garden . <\s>
<s> In a separate operation , the Ludendorff Bridge , crossing the Rhine at Remagen , became famous , when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the Germans failed to demolish it . <\s>
<s> This also became the subject of a film , The Bridge at Remagen . <\s>
<s> Seven Days to the River Rhine was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War . <\s>
<s> Until 1932 the generally accepted length of the Rhine was 1,230 kilometres . <\s>
<s> In 1932 the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon stated the length as 1,320 kilometres , presumably a typographical error . <\s>
<s> After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklopädie , it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications . <\s>
<s> The error was discovered in 2010 , and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at 1,232 kilometres . <\s>
<s> Following a referendum in 1997 , in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution , the current Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998 , which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature . <\s>
<s> The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are `` reserved '' to the Parliament of the United Kingdom . <\s>
<s> The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster . <\s>
<s> The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament , and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws . <\s>
<s> The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999 . <\s>
<s> For the next three hundred years , Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom , both seated at Westminster , and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity . <\s>
<s> Suggestions for a ' devolved ' Parliament were made before 1914 , but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War . <\s>
<s> A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence , and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution . <\s>
<s> One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland , within the unitary state of the United Kingdom . <\s>
<s> Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs . <\s>
<s> During this time , the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following `` It 's Scotland 's oil '' campaign of the Scottish National Party resulted in rising support for Scottish independence , as well as the SNP . <\s>
<s> The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should . <\s>
<s> The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974 . <\s>
<s> However , it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament . <\s>
<s> Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978 , an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that the majority of the Scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 March 1979 that represented at least 40 % of the total electorate . <\s>
<s> The 1979 Scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly failed . <\s>
<s> Although the vote was 51.6 % in favour of a Scottish Assembly , this figure did not equal the 40 % of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure , as 32.9 % of the eligible voting population did not , or had been unable to , vote . <\s>
<s> Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , demand for a Scottish Parliament grew , in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party , while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs . <\s>
<s> In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat , the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group , leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches , political parties and representatives of industry taking part . <\s>
<s> Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995 , the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament . <\s>
<s> Since September 2004 , the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building , in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh . <\s>
<s> The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle . <\s>
<s> Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings , a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings . <\s>
<s> Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs , such as shapes based on Raeburn 's Skating Minister . <\s>
<s> Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby , complete the unique architecture . <\s>
<s> Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004 . <\s>
<s> Whilst the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed , the Parliament 's temporary home was the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh . <\s>
<s> Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall , which is part of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh . <\s>
<s> This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church 's General Assembly . <\s>
<s> In May 2000 , the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow , and to the University of Aberdeen in May 2002 . <\s>
<s> In addition to the General Assembly Hall , the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council . <\s>
<s> The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP 's offices . <\s>
<s> Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished . <\s>
<s> The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square , High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh housed the Parliament 's visitors ' centre and shop , whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament 's principal committee room . <\s>
<s> After each election to the Scottish Parliament , at the beginning of each parliamentary session , Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer , the equivalent of the speaker , and two MSPs to serve as deputies . <\s>
<s> The Presiding Officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs , which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament . <\s>
<s> Principally , the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body . <\s>
<s> When chairing meetings of the Parliament , the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial . <\s>
<s> During debates , the Presiding Officer is assisted by the parliamentary clerks , who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings . <\s>
<s> A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks . <\s>
<s> As a member of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body , the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff , property and resources it requires to operate . <\s>
<s> Convening the Parliamentary Bureau , which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber , is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer . <\s>
<s> Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the Parliament . <\s>
<s> Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber , establish the number , remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation through the Parliament . <\s>
<s> The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity . <\s>
<s> The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle , which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members . <\s>
<s> There are 131 seats in the debating chamber . <\s>
<s> Of the total 131 seats , 129 are occupied by the Parliament 's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers – the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland , who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government . <\s>
<s> As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but , as they are not elected MSPs , can not vote . <\s>
<s> Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber , but typically sit in their party groupings . <\s>
<s> The First Minister , Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row , in the middle section of the chamber . <\s>
<s> The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle , with opposing parties on either side . <\s>
<s> The Presiding Officer , parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber . <\s>
<s> In front of the Presiding Officers ' desk is the parliamentary mace , which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words : Wisdom , Compassion , Justice and Integrity . <\s>
<s> The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament , which are the first words of the Scotland Act , are inscribed around the head of the mace , which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament , reinforcing the authority of the Parliament in its ability to make laws . <\s>
<s> Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening in July 1999 , the mace is displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid . <\s>
<s> At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber , the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass , to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place . <\s>
<s> Parliament typically sits Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December , with two-week recesses in April and October . <\s>
<s> Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Thursdays from 9 : 15 am to 6 pm . <\s>
<s> Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public . <\s>
<s> Entry is free , but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space . <\s>
<s> Meetings are broadcast on the Parliament 's own channel Holyrood.tv and on the BBC 's parliamentary channel BBC Parliament . <\s>
<s> Proceedings are also recorded in text form , in print and online , in the Official Report , which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates . <\s>
<s> The first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time for Reflection , at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith . <\s>
<s> This contrasts with the formal style of `` Prayers '' , which is the first item of business in meetings of the House of Commons . <\s>
<s> Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the Scottish census . <\s>
<s> Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau . <\s>
<s> Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers . <\s>
<s> The Presiding Officer decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak . <\s>
<s> Normally , the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak . <\s>
<s> Typically , ministers or party leaders open debates , with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time . <\s>
<s> The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate . <\s>
<s> Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems . <\s>
<s> Members may call each other directly by name , rather than by constituency or cabinet position , and hand clapping is allowed . <\s>
<s> Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English , but members may use Scots , Gaelic , or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer . <\s>
<s> The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language . <\s>
<s> Each sitting day , normally at 5 pm , MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day . <\s>
<s> This `` Decision Time '' is heralded by the sounding of the division bell , which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote . <\s>
<s> At Decision Time , the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking `` Are we all agreed ? '' , to which the chamber first votes orally . <\s>
<s> If there is audible dissent , the Presiding Officer announces `` There will be a division '' and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks . <\s>
<s> Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which , when inserted into the console , identifies them and allows them to vote . <\s>
<s> As a result , the outcome of each division is known in seconds . <\s>
<s> The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote . <\s>
<s> Parties entrust some MSPs , known as whips , with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line . <\s>
<s> MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions , since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties . <\s>
<s> Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections , and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright . <\s>
<s> Thus , as with many Parliaments , the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low , and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party 's policies are rare . <\s>
<s> In some circumstances , however , parties announce `` free votes '' , which allows Members to vote as they please . <\s>
<s> This is typically done on moral issues . <\s>
<s> Immediately after Decision Time a `` Members Debate '' is held , which lasts for 45 minutes . <\s>
<s> Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister . <\s>
<s> Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member 's own constituency , an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time . <\s>
<s> As well as the proposer , other members normally contribute to the debate . <\s>
<s> The relevant minister , whose department the debate and motion relate to `` winds up '' the debate by speaking after all other participants . <\s>
<s> Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee . <\s>
<s> The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems , partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber . <\s>
<s> The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses , conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation . <\s>
<s> Committee meetings take place on Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting . <\s>
<s> Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland . <\s>
<s> Committees comprise a small number of MSPs , with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament . <\s>
<s> There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways . <\s>
<s> Mandatory Committees are committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament 's standing orders , which govern their remits and proceedings . <\s>
<s> The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are : Public Audit ; Equal Opportunities ; European and External Relations ; Finance ; Public Petitions ; Standards , Procedures and Public Appointments ; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform . <\s>
<s> Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session , and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament . <\s>
<s> Typically each committee corresponds with one of the departments of the Scottish Government . <\s>
<s> The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are : Economy , Energy and Tourism ; Education and Culture ; Health and Sport ; Justice ; Local Government and Regeneration ; Rural Affairs , Climate Change and Environment ; Welfare Reform ; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment . <\s>
<s> A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government . <\s>
<s> Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property . <\s>
<s> Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network , the Glasgow Airport Rail Link , the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland . <\s>
<s> The Scotland Act 1998 , which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998 , governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence . <\s>
<s> The Scotland Act 2012 extends the devolved competencies . <\s>
<s> For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty , the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland . <\s>
<s> However , under the terms of the Scotland Act , Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament . <\s>
<s> Such `` devolved matters '' include education , health , agriculture and justice . <\s>
<s> The Scotland Act enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues . <\s>
<s> A degree of domestic authority , and all foreign policy , remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster . <\s>
<s> The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability . <\s>
<s> Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account . <\s>
<s> The specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters . <\s>
<s> All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament . <\s>
<s> Most importantly , this includes agriculture , fisheries and forestry , economic development , education , environment , food standards , health , home affairs , Scots law – courts , police and fire services , local government , sport and the arts , transport , training , tourism , research and statistics and social work . <\s>
<s> The Scottish Parliament has the ability to alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound . <\s>
<s> The 2012 Act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns . <\s>
<s> Reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament . <\s>
<s> The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to , and dealt with at , Westminster . <\s>
<s> These include abortion , broadcasting policy , civil service , common markets for UK goods and services , constitution , electricity , coal , oil , gas , nuclear energy , defence and national security , drug policy , employment , foreign policy and relations with Europe , most aspects of transport safety and regulation , National Lottery , protection of borders , social security and stability of UK 's fiscal , economic and monetary system . <\s>
<s> Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways ; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill ; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit ; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member ; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer . <\s>
<s> Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party . <\s>
<s> Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages . <\s>
<s> Stage 1 is the first , or introductory stage of the bill , where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to Parliament together with its accompanying documents – Explanatory Notes , a Policy Memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a Financial Memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it . <\s>
<s> Statements from the Presiding Officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament . <\s>
<s> Stage 1 usually takes place , initially , in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole Parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill . <\s>
<s> If the whole Parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill , it then proceeds to Stage 2 . <\s>
<s> Stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole Parliament . <\s>
<s> This stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill . <\s>
<s> Opposition members can table `` wrecking amendments '' to the bill , designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken . <\s>
<s> After a general debate on the final form of the bill , members proceed to vote at Decision Time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill . <\s>
<s> Royal assent : After the bill has been passed , the Presiding Officer submits it to the Monarch for royal assent and it becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament . <\s>
<s> However he can not do so until a 4-week period has elapsed , during which the Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the Parliament . <\s>
<s> Acts of the Scottish Parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula . <\s>
<s> Instead they begin with a phrase that reads : `` The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on and received royal assent on '' . <\s>
<s> The party , or parties , that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government . <\s>
<s> In contrast to many other parliamentary systems , Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term . <\s>
<s> Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister , and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament . <\s>
<s> Normally , the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister , and head of the Scottish Government . <\s>
<s> Theoretically , Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet , but such ministers are , in practice , appointed to their roles by the First Minister . <\s>
<s> Junior ministers , who do not attend cabinet , are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments . <\s>
<s> Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs , with the exception of Scotland 's Chief Law Officers : the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General . <\s>
<s> Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign . <\s>
<s> Under the Scotland Act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years . <\s>
<s> The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer . <\s>
<s> If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved , or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant , the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation . <\s>
<s> Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections , unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election , in which case they supplant it . <\s>
<s> The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May , a multiple of four years after 1999 . <\s>
<s> Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government . <\s>
<s> The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question . <\s>
<s> For example , at the beginning of each parliamentary year , the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year . <\s>
<s> After the statement has been delivered , the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement . <\s>
<s> Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber . <\s>
<s> A `` General Question Time '' takes place on a Thursday between 11 : 40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government . <\s>
<s> At 2.30pm , a 40-minute long themed `` Question Time '' takes place , where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day , such as health and justice or education and transport . <\s>
<s> Between 12 p.m. and 12 : 30 p.m. on Thursdays , when Parliament is sitting , First Minister 's Question Time takes place . <\s>
<s> This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction . <\s>
<s> Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions . <\s>
<s> Such a practice enables a `` lead-in '' to the questioner , who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue . <\s>
<s> The four general questions available to opposition leaders are . <\s>
<s> Of the 129 MSPs , 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as `` Constituency MSPs '' . <\s>
<s> Voters choose one member to represent the constituency , and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP . <\s>
<s> The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland , prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs , with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP . <\s>
<s> Currently , the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors . <\s>
<s> Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland , this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands , where the bulk of Scotland 's population live , and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country , which have a low population density . <\s>
<s> The island archipelagos of Orkney , Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors , due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh . <\s>
<s> If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament , this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency , where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system . <\s>
<s> The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d ' Hondt method . <\s>
<s> For example , to determine who is awarded the first list seat , the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region . <\s>
<s> The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat . <\s>
<s> This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated . <\s>
<s> As in the House of Commons , a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP . <\s>
<s> Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981 . <\s>
<s> Specifically , members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom , the Republic of Ireland , one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations , a citizen of a British overseas territory , or a European Union citizen resident in the UK . <\s>
<s> Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs , and similarly , civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified . <\s>
<s> An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health Act 2003 . <\s>
<s> The election produced a majority SNP government , making this the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority . <\s>
<s> The SNP took 16 seats from Labour , with many of their key figures not returned to parliament , although Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes . <\s>
<s> The SNP took a further eight seats from the Liberal Democrats and one seat from the Conservatives . <\s>
<s> The SNP overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum on Scottish independence . <\s>
<s> For the Conservatives , the main disappointment was the loss of Edinburgh Pentlands , the seat of former party leader David McLetchie , to the SNP . <\s>
<s> McLetchie was elected on the Lothian regional list and the Conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats , with leader Annabel Goldie claiming that their support had held firm . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , she too announced she would step down as leader of the party . <\s>
<s> Cameron congratulated the SNP on their victory but vowed to campaign for the Union in the independence referendum . <\s>
<s> A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England , Wales and Northern Ireland – whilst English , Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament . <\s>
<s> This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism . <\s>
<s> Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 UK election , standing orders of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new `` veto '' over laws only affecting England . <\s>
<s> Islamism , also known as Political Islam , is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism , literalism , and the attempt `` to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life . '' <\s>
<s> Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari ' a . <\s>
<s> The different Islamist movements have been described as `` oscillating between two poles '' : at one end is a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion ; at the other `` reformist '' pole Islamists work to Islamize society gradually `` from the bottom up '' . <\s>
<s> The movements have `` arguably altered the Middle East more than any trend since the modern states gained independence '' , redefining `` politics and even borders '' according to one journalist . <\s>
<s> Moderate and reformist Islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the Tunisian Ennahda Movement . <\s>
<s> Jamaat-e-Islami of Pakistan is basically a socio-political and democratic Vanguard party but has also gained political influence through military coup d'état in past . <\s>
<s> The Islamist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine participate in democratic and political process as well as armed attacks , seeking to abolish the state of Israel . <\s>
<s> Radical Islamist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad , and groups such as the Taliban , entirely reject democracy , often declaring as kuffar those Muslims who support it , as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis . <\s>
<s> Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E. Fuller has described as the fundamentalist `` guardians of the tradition '' and the `` vanguard of change and Islamic reform '' centered around the Muslim Brotherhood . <\s>
<s> Olivier Roy argues that `` Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century '' when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on `` sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions , '' and rejection of Shia Islam . <\s>
<s> Following the Arab Spring , Roy has described Islamism as `` increasingly interdependent '' with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world , such that `` neither can now survive without the other . '' <\s>
<s> While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic , Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy . <\s>
<s> At the same time , their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups . <\s>
<s> Islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for Islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect Islam , while the contrary idea that Islam is , or can be , apolitical is an error . <\s>
<s> Scholars and observers who do not believe that Islam is merely a political ideology include Fred Halliday , John Esposito and Muslim intellectuals like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi . <\s>
<s> Hayri Abaza argues the failure to distinguish between Islam and Islamism leads many in the West to support illiberal Islamic regimes , to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics . <\s>
<s> Islamists have asked the question , `` If Islam is a way of life , how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal , social , political , economic , and political spheres of life are not Muslims , but Islamists and believe in Islamism , not Islam ? '' <\s>
<s> Similarly , a writer for the International Crisis Group maintains that `` the conception of ' political Islam ' '' is a creation of Americans to explain the Iranian Islamic Revolution and apolitical Islam was a historical fluke of the `` short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970 '' , and it is quietist/non-political Islam , not Islamism , that requires explanation . <\s>
<s> During the 1970s and sometimes later , Western and pro-Western governments often supported sometimes fledgling Islamists and Islamist groups that later came to be seen as dangerous enemies . <\s>
<s> Islamists were considered by Western governments bulwarks against — what were thought to be at the time — more dangerous leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition , which Islamists were correctly seen as opposing . <\s>
<s> The US spent billions of dollars to aid the mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan enemies of the Soviet Union , and non-Afghan veterans of the war returned home with their prestige , `` experience , ideology , and weapons '' , and had considerable impact . <\s>
<s> Egyptian President Anwar Sadat – whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment ; transferring Egypt 's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States ; and making peace with Israel – released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists . <\s>
<s> His `` encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement '' was said to have been `` imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed . '' <\s>
<s> This `` gentlemen 's agreement '' between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions . <\s>
<s> Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s . <\s>
<s> The French government has also been reported to have promoted Islamist preachers `` in the hope of channeling Muslim energies into zones of piety and charity . '' <\s>
<s> The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict , conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism . <\s>
<s> In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only `` always oppose '' infidels `` in every way , '' but `` hate them for their religion ... for Allah 's sake , '' that democracy `` is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century , '' that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels , etc . <\s>
<s> While this effort has by no means converted all , or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam , it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations , and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the `` gold standard '' of religion in minds of some or many Muslims . <\s>
<s> Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood , `` are well known for providing shelters , educational assistance , free or low cost medical clinics , housing assistance to students from out of town , student advisory groups , facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands , legal assistance , sports facilities , and women 's groups . '' <\s>
<s> All this compares very favourably against incompetent , inefficient , or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric . <\s>
<s> While studying law and philosophy in England and Germany , Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All India Muslim League . <\s>
<s> He came back to Lahore in 1908 . <\s>
<s> While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry , Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League . <\s>
<s> He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Muhammad Ali Johar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah . <\s>
<s> He was a critic of the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress . <\s>
<s> Iqbal 's seven English lectures were published by Oxford University press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam . <\s>
<s> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age . <\s>
<s> Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society , but that India 's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage , culture and political influence . <\s>
<s> In his travels to Egypt , Afghanistan , Palestine and Syria , he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity , calling for the shedding of nationalist differences . <\s>
<s> Sir Muhammad Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in Allahabad as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932 . <\s>
<s> In his Allahabad Address on 29 December 1930 , Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India . <\s>
<s> This address later inspired the Pakistan movement . <\s>
<s> Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the Islamic revival in India , and then after independence from Britain , in Pakistan . <\s>
<s> Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism , and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law . <\s>
<s> Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972 . <\s>
<s> However , Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising . <\s>
<s> His extremely influential books placed Islam in a modern context , and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer Islamists such as al-Faruqi , whose `` Islamization of Knowledge '' carried forward some of Maududi 's key principles . <\s>
<s> Maududi also believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia , and Islam required the establishment of an Islamic state . <\s>
<s> This state should be a `` theo-democracy , '' based on the principles of : tawhid , risala and khilafa . <\s>
<s> Although Maududi talked about Islamic revolution , by `` revolution '' he meant not the violence or populist policies of the Iranian Revolution , but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da ' wah . <\s>
<s> Roughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailiyah , Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al Banna . <\s>
<s> His was arguably the first , largest and most influential modern Islamic political/religious organization . <\s>
<s> Under the motto `` the Qur ' an is our constitution , '' it sought Islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools , mosques , and workshops . <\s>
<s> Like Maududi , Al Banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on Shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion , and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the Muslim world . <\s>
<s> Some elements of the Brotherhood , though perhaps against orders , did engage in violence against the government , and its founder Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of Egypt 's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi three months earlier . <\s>
<s> The Brotherhood has suffered periodic repression in Egypt and has been banned several times , in 1948 and several years later following confrontations with Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser , who jailed thousands of members for several years . <\s>
<s> Despite periodic repression , the Brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the Islamic world , particularly in the Arab world . <\s>
<s> For many years it was described as `` semi-legal '' and was the only opposition group in Egypt able to field candidates during elections . <\s>
<s> In the Egyptian parliamentary election , 2011–2012 , the political parties identified as `` Islamist '' won 75 % of the total seats . <\s>
<s> Mohamed Morsi , an Islamist democrat of Muslim Brotherhood , was the first democratically elected president of Egypt . <\s>
<s> He was deposed during the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état . <\s>
<s> The quick and decisive defeat of the Arab troops during the Six-Day War by Israeli troops constituted a pivotal event in the Arab Muslim world . <\s>
<s> The defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries , was blamed on the secular Arab nationalism of the ruling regimes . <\s>
<s> A steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular , socialist and nationalist politics ensued . <\s>
<s> Ba ' athism , Arab socialism , and Arab nationalism suffered , and different democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements inspired by Maududi and Sayyid Qutb gained ground . <\s>
<s> The views of Ali Shariati , ideologue of the Iranian Revolution , had resemblance with Mohammad Iqbal , ideological father of the State of Pakistan , but Khomeini 's beliefs is perceived to be placed somewhere between beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb . <\s>
<s> He believed that complete imitation of the Prophet Mohammad and his successors such as Ali for restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam , that many secular , Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West serving Western interests , and that the acts such as `` plundering '' of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by the Western governments . <\s>
<s> The Islamic Republic has also maintained its hold on power in Iran in spite of US economic sanctions , and has created or assisted like-minded Shia terrorist groups in Iraq , Egypt , Syria , Jordan and Lebanon . <\s>
<s> During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict , the Iranian government enjoyed something of a resurgence in popularity amongst the predominantly Sunni `` Arab street , '' due to its support for Hezbollah and to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's vehement opposition to the United States and his call that Israel shall vanish . <\s>
<s> In 1979 , the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan , attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the Afghan Civil War . <\s>
<s> The conflict , pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims against an anti-religious superpower , galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith . <\s>
<s> Leading this pan-Islamic effort was Palestinian sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam . <\s>
<s> While the military effectiveness of these `` Afghan Arabs '' was marginal , an estimated 16,000 to 35,000 Muslim volunteers came from around the world came to fight in Afghanistan . <\s>
<s> Another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the Islamist movement was the Gulf War , which brought several hundred thousand US and allied non-Muslim military personnel to Saudi Arabian soil to put an end to Saddam Hussein 's occupation of Kuwait . <\s>
<s> Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid . <\s>
<s> But when Saddam , secularist and Ba ' athist dictator of neighboring Iraq , attacked Saudi Arabia , western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy . <\s>
<s> Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west . <\s>
<s> These attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam 's defeat either , since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom , and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed . <\s>
<s> Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it , and increasing aid to Islamic groups that did not , but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced . <\s>
<s> One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in Egypt , a bloody civil war in Algeria and Osama bin Laden 's terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack . <\s>
<s> While Qutb 's ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in 1966 , the leadership of the Brotherhood , led by Hasan al-Hudaybi , remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism . <\s>
<s> Fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s did , however , develop and they pursued a more radical direction . <\s>
<s> By the 1970s , the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals . <\s>
<s> The path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 . <\s>
<s> Unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the extremist group directed its attacks against what it believed were `` apostate '' leaders of Muslim states , leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies . <\s>
<s> Its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag , in which he states . <\s>
<s> Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was al-Gama ' a al-Islamiyya . <\s>
<s> Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police , a parliamentary speaker , dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders , and over 100 Egyptian police . <\s>
<s> Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful , and the major jihadi group , Jamaa Islamiya , renounced violence in 2003 . <\s>
<s> Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party , Salvation from Hell and Takfir wal-Hijra , and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures , arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings . <\s>
<s> For some decades prior to the First Palestine Intifada in 1987 , the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine took a `` quiescent '' stance towards Israel , focusing on preaching , education and social services , and benefiting from Israel 's `` indulgence '' to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations . <\s>
<s> As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising , the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS , devoted to Jihad against Israel . <\s>
<s> Rather than being more moderate than the PLO , the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand , calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine . <\s>
<s> It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada . <\s>
<s> The Brotherhood 's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab . <\s>
<s> Hamas has continued to be a major player in Palestine . <\s>
<s> From 2000 to 2007 it killed 542 people in 140 suicide bombing or `` martyrdom operations '' . <\s>
<s> In the January 2006 legislative election — its first foray into the political process — it won the majority of the seats , and in 2007 it drove the PLO out of Gaza . <\s>
<s> Hamas has been praised by Muslims for driving Israel out of the Gaza Strip , but criticized for failure to achieve its demands in the 2008-9 and 2014 Gaza Wars despite heavy destruction and significant loss of life . <\s>
<s> For many years , Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of Hassan al-Turabi . <\s>
<s> His National Islamic Front first gained influence when strongman General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979 . <\s>
<s> Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems , especially those linked with Saudi Arabia . <\s>
<s> He also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education . <\s>
<s> After al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections , but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military . <\s>
<s> Turabi was noted for proclaiming his support for the democratic process and a liberal government before coming to power , but strict application of sharia law , torture and mass imprisonment of the opposition , and an intensification of the long-running war in southern Sudan , once in power . <\s>
<s> The NIF regime also harbored Osama bin Laden for a time , and worked to unify Islamist opposition to the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War . <\s>
<s> An Islamist movement influenced by Salafism and the jihad in Afghanistan , as well as the Muslim Brotherhood , was the FIS or Front Islamique de Salut in Algeria . <\s>
<s> Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by Abbassi Madani , and a charismatic Islamist young preacher , Ali Belhadj . <\s>
<s> Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government , it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law , economic liberalization and development program , education in Arabic rather than French , and gender segregation , with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men . <\s>
<s> The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'état . <\s>
<s> In Afghanistan , the mujahideen 's victory against the Soviet Union in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity , due to a vicious and destructive civil war between political and tribal warlords , making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth . <\s>
<s> In 1992 , the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan ruled by communist forces collapsed , and democratic Islamist elements of mujahdeen founded the Islamic State of Afghanistan . <\s>
<s> In 1996 , a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the Taliban rose to power , defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80 % of Afghanistan . <\s>
<s> The Taliban were spawned by the thousands of madrasahs the Deobandi movement established for impoverished Afghan refugees and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan . <\s>
<s> The Taliban differed from other Islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as Islamic fundamentalist or neofundamentalist , interested in spreading `` an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs '' under the label of Sharia to an entire country . <\s>
<s> Their ideology was also described as being influenced by Wahhabism , and the extremist jihadism of their guest Osama bin Laden . <\s>
<s> In July 1977 , General Zia-ul-Haq overthrew Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto 's regime in Pakistan . <\s>
<s> Ali Bhutto , a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists , had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months , shortly before he was overthrown . <\s>
<s> Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism , and `` Islamization '' or implementation of Islamic law , became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his `` official state ideology '' . <\s>
<s> Zia ul Haq was an admirer of Mawdudi and Mawdudi 's party Jamaat-e-Islami became the `` regime 's ideological and political arm '' . <\s>
<s> In Pakistan this Islamization from above was `` probably '' more complete `` than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan , '' but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing `` symbols '' rather than substance , and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power . <\s>
<s> Unlike neighboring Iran , Zia-ul-Haq 's policies were intended to `` avoid revolutionary excess '' , and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies . <\s>
<s> Zia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988 but Islamization remains an important element in Pakistani society . <\s>
<s> `` The Islamic State '' , formerly known as the `` Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant '' and before that as the `` Islamic State of Iraq '' , , is a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria . <\s>
<s> In 2014 , the group proclaimed itself a caliphate , with religious , political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide . <\s>
<s> As of March 2015 , it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria , and has nominal control over small areas of Libya , Nigeria and Afghanistan . <\s>
<s> While a self-described state , it lacks international recognition . <\s>
<s> The group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world , including North Africa and South Asia . <\s>
<s> Originating as the Jama ' at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999 , it pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2004 , participated in the Iraqi insurgency that followed the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces , joined the fight in the Syrian Civil War beginning in March 2011 , and was expelled from al-Qaeda in early 2014 , . <\s>
<s> The group gained prominence after it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in western Iraq in a 2014 offensive . <\s>
<s> The group is adept at social media , posting Internet videos of beheadings of soldiers , civilians , journalists and aid workers , and is known for its destruction of cultural heritage sites . <\s>
<s> The United Nations has held ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes , and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a `` historic scale '' . <\s>
<s> The group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations , the European Union and member states , the United States , India , Indonesia , Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Syria and other countries . <\s>
<s> In its focus on the Caliphate , the party takes a different view of Muslim history than some other Islamists such as Muhammad Qutb . <\s>
<s> HT sees Islam 's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of Ali , or one of the other four rightly guided Caliphs in the 7th century , but with the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 . <\s>
<s> This is believed to have ended the true Islamic system , something for which it blames `` the disbelieving colonial powers '' working through Turkish modernist Mustafa Kemal Atatürk . <\s>
<s> HT does not engage in armed jihad or work for a democratic system , but works to take power through `` ideological struggle '' to change Muslim public opinion , and in particular through elites who will `` facilitate '' a `` change of the government , '' i.e. , launch a `` bloodless '' coup . <\s>
<s> It allegedly attempted and failed such coups in 1968 and 1969 in Jordan , and in 1974 in Egypt , and is now banned in both countries . <\s>
<s> But many HT members have gone on to join terrorist groups and many jihadi terrorists have cited HT as their key influence . <\s>
<s> Greater London has over 900,000 Muslims , , and among them are some with a strong Islamist outlook . <\s>
<s> Their presence , combined with a perceived British policy of allowing them free rein , heightened by exposés such as the 2007 Channel 4 documentary programme Undercover Mosque , has given rise to the term Londonistan . <\s>
<s> Following the 9/11 attacks , however , Abu Hamza al-Masri , the imam of the Finsbury Park Mosque , was arrested and charged with incitement to terrorism which has caused many Islamists to leave the UK to avoid internment . <\s>
<s> The U.S. government has engaged in efforts to counter Islamism , or violent Islamism , since 2001 . <\s>
<s> These efforts were centred in the U.S. around public diplomacy programmes conducted by the State Department . <\s>
<s> There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Islamism and jihadism . <\s>
<s> Christian Whiton , an official in the George W. Bush administration , called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of `` political warfare '' aimed at undermining the ideology . <\s>
<s> U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for establishing something similar to the defunct U.S. Information Agency , which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War . <\s>
<s> Imperialism is a type of advocacy of empire . <\s>
<s> Its name originated from the Latin word `` imperium '' , which means to rule over large territories . <\s>
<s> Imperialism is `` a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means '' . <\s>
<s> Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world . <\s>
<s> It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas . <\s>
<s> The term imperialism has been applied to Western political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries . <\s>
<s> Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars . <\s>
<s> Some writers , such as Edward Said , use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery . <\s>
<s> Imperialism is defined as `` A policy of extending a country 's power and influence through diplomacy or military force . '' <\s>
<s> Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group , often a state power , has on another group of people . <\s>
<s> This is often through various forms of `` othering '' based on racial , religious , or cultural stereotypes . <\s>
<s> There are `` formal '' or `` informal '' imperialisms . <\s>
<s> `` Formal imperialism '' is defined as `` physical control or full-fledged colonial rule '' . <\s>
<s> `` Informal imperialism '' is less direct ; however , it is still a powerful form of dominance . <\s>
<s> The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers , or simply , general-purpose aggressiveness . <\s>
<s> Further on , some writers used the term imperialism , in slightly more discriminating fashion , to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another . <\s>
<s> To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of `` formal '' and `` informal '' imperialism , the first meaning physical control or `` full-fledged colonial rule '' while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance . <\s>
<s> Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally . <\s>
<s> This is because , with informal rule , the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority , enforcing land officials into large debts that can not be repaid , ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area , or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully . <\s>
<s> `` The word ' empire ' comes from the Latin word imperium ; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be sovereignty , or simply rule '' . <\s>
<s> The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded . <\s>
<s> Political power grew from conquering land , however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes . <\s>
<s> A distinction about empires is `` that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland , economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea '' . <\s>
<s> Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products . <\s>
<s> European empires in Asia and Africa `` have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism : and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires '' . <\s>
<s> European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory . <\s>
<s> The two main regions are the core and the periphery . <\s>
<s> The core consists of high areas of income and profit ; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit . <\s>
<s> These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world . <\s>
<s> The Russian leader Lenin suggested that `` imperialism was the highest form of capitalism , claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism , and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism '' . <\s>
<s> This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era . <\s>
<s> Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market ; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations . <\s>
<s> The term `` imperialism '' is often conflated with `` colonialism '' , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition . <\s>
<s> Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people . <\s>
<s> Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions . <\s>
<s> Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power . <\s>
<s> Particularly , Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating ; imperialism involved the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory , while colonialism refers to the implanting of settlements on a distant territory . <\s>
<s> Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism . <\s>
<s> Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus . <\s>
<s> Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control , yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two . <\s>
<s> Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other , if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another , imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance , either formally or informally . <\s>
<s> Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism . <\s>
<s> Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled . <\s>
<s> Colonialism 's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war . <\s>
<s> The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire , by conquering the other state 's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance . <\s>
<s> Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region . <\s>
<s> Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure , physical structure and economics of an area ; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations . <\s>
<s> The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries . <\s>
<s> These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories . <\s>
<s> Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism . <\s>
<s> Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state 's survival while Mackinder supported Britain 's imperial expansion ; these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades . <\s>
<s> Geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of European guidance . <\s>
<s> For instance , American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone . <\s>
<s> Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said 's Orientalism as the west 's construction of the east as the `` other '' . <\s>
<s> According to Siad , orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm , which justified its dominance over the essentialized Orient . <\s>
<s> The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the British Empire `` during the last generation , and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description '' . <\s>
<s> British imperialism often used the concept of Terra nullius . <\s>
<s> The country of Australia serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century , as it was premised on terra nullius , and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse Aboriginal inhabitants . <\s>
<s> Orientalism , as theorized by Edward Said , refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East . <\s>
<s> This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East . <\s>
<s> Rather , by essentializing the East , this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between `` we '' the West and `` them '' the East , or `` here '' in the West and `` there '' in the East . <\s>
<s> This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West . <\s>
<s> Defining the East as a negative vision of itself , as its inferior , not only increased the West 's sense of self , but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled . <\s>
<s> The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism , as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social , cultural , political , and economic control of other territories . <\s>
<s> To better illustrate this idea , Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the `` scramble for Africa '' . <\s>
<s> He states that maps `` contributed to empire by promoting , assisting , and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa '' . <\s>
<s> During his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory . <\s>
<s> This provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain `` information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps '' . <\s>
<s> Imperialism has played an important role in the histories of Japan , Korea , the Assyrian Empire , the Chinese Empire , the Roman Empire , Greece , the Byzantine Empire , the Persian Empire , the Ottoman Empire , Ancient Egypt , the British Empire , India , and many other empires . <\s>
<s> Imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of Genghis Khan during the Mongol Empire , and of other war-lords . <\s>
<s> Historically recognized Muslim empires number in the dozens . <\s>
<s> Sub-Saharan Africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the European colonial era , for example the Ethiopian Empire , Oyo Empire , Asante Union , Luba Empire , Lunda Empire , and Mutapa Empire . <\s>
<s> The Americas during the pre-Columbian era also had large empires such as the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire . <\s>
<s> Cultural imperialism is when a country 's influence is felt in social and cultural circles , i.e. its soft power , such that it changes the moral , cultural and societal worldview of another . <\s>
<s> This is more than just `` foreign '' music , television or film becoming popular with young people , but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted . <\s>
<s> For example , depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians ; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea . <\s>
<s> The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes , fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture , control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc . <\s>
<s> Nor is such a usage of culture recent , as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle , with the aim that they would then become willing participants . <\s>
<s> The Age of Imperialism , a time period beginning around 1700 , saw industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing , influencing , and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power . <\s>
<s> Although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years , the term `` Age of Imperialism '' generally refers to the activities of European powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century , for example , the `` The Great Game '' in Persian lands , the `` Scramble for Africa '' and the `` Open Door Policy '' in China . <\s>
<s> During the 20th century , historians John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism . <\s>
<s> They claim that European imperialism was influential , and Europeans rejected the notion that `` imperialism '' required formal , legal control by one government over another country . <\s>
<s> In their view , historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red . <\s>
<s> The bulk of British emigration , trade , and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire . <\s>
<s> Key to their thinking is the idea of empire informally if possible and formally if necessary . <\s>
<s> Because of the resources made available by imperialism , the world 's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I , making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous . <\s>
<s> Europe 's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies , in combination with assuming political control by military and political means . <\s>
<s> The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus : there , the `` British exploited the political weakness of the Mughal state , and , while military activity was important at various times , the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance '' for the establishment of control over the subcontinent 's resources , markets , and manpower . <\s>
<s> Although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , Fieldhouse suggests that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in places such as Africa and Asia , this idea is not necessarily valid . <\s>
<s> Along with advancements in communication , Europe also continued to advance in military technology . <\s>
<s> European chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat , and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms . <\s>
<s> By the 1880s , the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon . <\s>
<s> This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents , as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows , swords , and leather shields . <\s>
<s> In anglophone academic works , theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience . <\s>
<s> The term `` Imperialism '' was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli . <\s>
<s> It was shortly appropriated by supporters of `` imperialism '' such as Joseph Chamberlain . <\s>
<s> For some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed . <\s>
<s> Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term . <\s>
<s> Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism . <\s>
<s> In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion . <\s>
<s> This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians . <\s>
<s> Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of `` imperialism '' . <\s>
<s> Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy , nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century , but a world system extending over a period of centuries , often going back to Christopher Columbus and , in some accounts , to the Crusades . <\s>
<s> As the application of the term has expanded , its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes : the moral , the economic , the systemic , the cultural , and the temporal . <\s>
<s> Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease , even squeamishness , with the fact of power , specifically , Western power . <\s>
<s> The concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples . <\s>
<s> It was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination . <\s>
<s> For example , people living in tropical environments were seen as `` less civilized '' therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission . <\s>
<s> Across the three waves of European colonialism , environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy . <\s>
<s> This takes two forms , orientalism and tropicality . <\s>
<s> According to geographic scholars under colonizing empires , the world could be split into climatic zones . <\s>
<s> These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working , moral , and upstanding human being . <\s>
<s> Alternatively , tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes , sexual promiscuity , exotic culture , and moral degeneracy . <\s>
<s> The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure ; they were seen as incapable of such a feat . <\s>
<s> Similarly , orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location <\s>
<s> Britain 's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century . <\s>
<s> In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year . <\s>
<s> With the establishment of trading posts in India , the British were able to maintain strength relative to others empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India . <\s>
<s> In 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy , almost bringing the company into bankruptcy . <\s>
<s> France took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850 , concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa , as well as South-East Asia , with other conquests in Central and East Africa , as well as the South Pacific . <\s>
<s> Republicans , at first hostile to empire , only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire . <\s>
<s> As it developed , the new empire took on roles of trade with France , supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items , as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism . <\s>
<s> It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars . <\s>
<s> It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture . <\s>
<s> In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism , Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission : `` The higher races have a right over the lower races , they have a duty to civilize the inferior '' . <\s>
<s> Full citizenship rights – `` assimilation '' – were offered , although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon . <\s>
<s> Contrasting from Britain , France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies , with the only notable exception of Algeria , where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority . <\s>
<s> In World War II , Charles de Gaulle and the Free French used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France . <\s>
<s> However after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the Empire . <\s>
<s> France fought and lost a bitter war in Vietnam in the 1950s . <\s>
<s> Whereas they won the war in Algeria , the French leader at the time , Charles de Gaulle , decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962 . <\s>
<s> Its settlers and many local supporters relocated to France . <\s>
<s> Nearly all of France 's colonies gained independence by 1960 , but France retained great financial and diplomatic influence . <\s>
<s> It has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in Africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d'état . <\s>
<s> From their original homelands in Scandinavia and northern Europe , Germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western Europe in the middle period of classical antiquity ; southern Europe in late antiquity , conquering Celtic and other peoples ; and by 800 CE , forming the Holy Roman Empire , the first German Empire . <\s>
<s> However , there was no real systemic continuity from the Western Roman Empire to its German successor which was famously described as `` not holy , not Roman , and not an empire '' , as a great number of small states and principalities existed in the loosely autonomous confederation . <\s>
<s> Although by 1000 CE , the Germanic conquest of central , western , and southern Europe was complete , excluding only Muslim Iberia . <\s>
<s> There was , however , little cultural integration or national identity , and `` Germany '' remained largely a conceptual term referring to an amorphous area of central Europe . <\s>
<s> Not a maritime power , and not a nation-state , as it would eventually become , Germany 's participation in Western imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century . <\s>
<s> The participation of Austria was primarily as a result of Habsburg control of the First Empire , the Spanish throne , and other royal houses . <\s>
<s> After the defeat of Napoleon , who caused the dissolution of that Holy Roman Empire , Prussia and the German states continued to stand aloof from imperialism , preferring to manipulate the European system through the Concert of Europe . <\s>
<s> After Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire after the Franco-German War , its long-time Chancellor , Otto von Bismarck , long opposed colonial acquisitions , arguing that the burden of obtaining , maintaining , and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits . <\s>
<s> He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves , that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest , Europe itself . <\s>
<s> However , in 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific , before losing interest in imperialism . <\s>
<s> Historians have debated exactly why Germany made this sudden and short-lived move . <\s>
<s> Bismarck was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of German prestige . <\s>
<s> He was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders , his neighbors at Friedrichsruh . <\s>
<s> The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly , starting with German New Guinea in 1884 . <\s>
<s> During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 , Japan absorbed Taiwan . <\s>
<s> As a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 , Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia . <\s>
<s> Korea was annexed in 1910 . <\s>
<s> During World War I , Japan took German-leased territories in China 's Shandong Province , as well as the Mariana , Caroline , and Marshall Islands . <\s>
<s> In 1918 , Japan occupied parts of far eastern Russia and parts of eastern Siberia as a participant in the Siberian Intervention . <\s>
<s> In 1931 Japan conquered Manchuria from China . <\s>
<s> During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 , Japan 's military invaded central China and by the end of the Pacific War , Japan had conquered much of the Far East , including Hong Kong , Vietnam , Cambodia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Indonesia , part of New Guinea and some islands of the Pacific Ocean . <\s>
<s> Japan also invaded Thailand , pressuring the country into a Thai/Japanese alliance . <\s>
<s> Its colonial ambitions were ended by the victory of the United States in the Second World War and the following treaties which remanded those territories to American administration or their original owners . <\s>
<s> Bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921 , however with an internationalist ideology : Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory . <\s>
<s> Beginning in 1923 , the policy of `` Indigenization '' was intended to support non-Russians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework . <\s>
<s> Never formally revoked , it stopped being implemented after 1932 . <\s>
<s> After World War II , the Soviet Union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919–20 in the old Tsarist Empire in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe . <\s>
<s> The Soviet Union and the People 's Republic of China supported post–World War II communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests , but were not always successful . <\s>
<s> Trotsky , and others , believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution . <\s>
<s> Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism . <\s>
<s> However , after Lenin 's death , Joseph Stalin established ' socialism in one country ' for the Soviet Union , creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements . <\s>
<s> The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War . <\s>
<s> With the beginning of the new era , the after Stalin period called the `` thaw '' , in the late 1950s , the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda . <\s>
<s> In his speech on the UN conference in 1960 , he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism , stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders . <\s>
<s> Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires . <\s>
<s> Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states . <\s>
<s> It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control . <\s>
<s> Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government . <\s>
<s> Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR , like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai , considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism . <\s>
<s> The First British Empire was based on mercantilism , and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America , the Caribbean , and India . <\s>
<s> Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776 . <\s>
<s> Britain made compensating gains in India , Australia , and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies about 1820 . <\s>
<s> By the 1840s , Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world . <\s>
<s> After losing its first Empire to the Americans , Britain then turned its attention towards Asia , Africa , and the Pacific . <\s>
<s> Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815 , Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe . <\s>
<s> Increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century . <\s>
<s> A resurgence came in the late 19th century , with the Scramble for Africa and major additions in Asia and the Middle East . <\s>
<s> The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Rosebury , and implemented in Africa by Cecil Rhodes . <\s>
<s> The pseudo-sciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time . <\s>
<s> Other influential spokesmen included Lord Cromer , Lord Curzon , General Kitchner , Lord Milner , and the writer Rudyard Kipling . <\s>
<s> The British Empire was the largest Empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population . <\s>
<s> Its power , both military and economic , remained unmatched . <\s>
<s> The early United States expressed its opposition to Imperialism , at least in a form distinct from its own Manifest Destiny , through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine . <\s>
<s> However , beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century , policies such as Theodore Roosevelt 's interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson 's mission to `` make the world safe for democracy '' changed all this . <\s>
<s> They were often backed by military force , but were more often affected from behind the scenes . <\s>
<s> This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires . <\s>
<s> In 1898 , Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba . <\s>
<s> One year later , a war erupted in the Philippines causing business , labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America 's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos . <\s>
<s> American foreign policy was denounced as a `` racket '' by Smedley Butler , an American general . <\s>
<s> He said , `` Looking back on it , I might have given Al Capone a few hints . '' <\s>
<s> The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts . <\s>
<s> I operated on three continents . <\s>
<s> One key figure in the plans for what would come to be known as American Empire , was a geographer named Isiah Bowman . <\s>
<s> Bowman was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914 . <\s>
<s> Three years later in 1917 , he was appointed to then President Woodrow Wilson 's inquiry in 1917 . <\s>
<s> The inquiry was the idea of President Wilson and the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference . <\s>
<s> The point of this inquiry was to build a premise that would allow for U.S authorship of a ' new world ' which was to be characterized by geographical order . <\s>
<s> As a result of his role in the inquiry , Isiah Bowman would come to be known as Wilson 's geographer . <\s>
<s> Some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism . <\s>
<s> This internal form is distinct from informal U.S. imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony . <\s>
<s> This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States ' formation of `` colonies '' abroad . <\s>
<s> Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion , the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism . <\s>
<s> This internal form of empire has been referred to as `` internal colonialism '' . <\s>
<s> Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America 's `` internal colonialism '' . <\s>
<s> However , this internal colonialism faced resistance , as external colonialism did , but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans . <\s>
<s> In his lecture on April 16 , 2003 , Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States , whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient , `` due to their backward living , lack of democracy and the violation of women 's rights '' . <\s>
<s> The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon . <\s>
<s> The Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923 . <\s>
<s> During the 16th and 17th centuries , in particular at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational , multilingual empire controlling much of Southeast Europe , Western Asia , the Caucasus , North Africa , and the Horn of Africa . <\s>
<s> At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . <\s>
<s> Some of these were later absorbed into the empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . <\s>
<s> With Istanbul as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . <\s>
<s> Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers , the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century . <\s>
<s> The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century , with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories , but it dissolved in the aftermath of World War I , leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland , as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states , thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions . <\s>
<s> Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland . <\s>
<s> It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland , roughly 260 kilometres from the Baltic Sea and 300 kilometres from the Carpathian Mountains . <\s>
<s> Its population is estimated at 1.740 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents , which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union . <\s>
<s> The city limits cover 516.9 square kilometres , while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres . <\s>

<s> The first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313 , at a time when Kraków served as the Polish capital city . <\s>
<s> Due to its central location between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth 's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius , Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596 . <\s>
<s> After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 , Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia . <\s>

<s> Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland . <\s>
<s> The German invasion in 1939 , the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 . <\s>
<s> Warsaw gained the title of the `` Phoenix City '' because it has survived many wars , conflicts and invasions throughout its long history . <\s>
<s> Most notably , the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II , which destroyed 85 % of its buildings . <\s>
<s> On 9 November 1940 , the city was awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for heroism , the Virtuti Militari , during the Siege of Warsaw . <\s>
<s> The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese and diocese , and possesses various universities , most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw , two opera houses , theatres , museums , libraries and monuments . <\s>

<s> Other main architectural attractions include the Castle Square with the Royal Castle and the iconic King Sigismund 's Column , St. John 's Cathedral , Market Square , palaces , churches and mansions all displaying a richness of colour and architectural detail . <\s>
<s> Buildings represent examples of nearly every European architectural style and historical period . <\s>
<s> Warsaw provides many examples of architecture from the gothic , renaissance , baroque and neoclassical periods , and around a quarter of the city is filled with luxurious parks and royal gardens . <\s>
<s> Warsaw 's name in the Polish language is Warszawa , approximately /vɑːrˈʃɑːvə/ , meaning `` belonging to Warsz '' , Warsz being a shortened form of the masculine name of Slavic origin Warcisław ; see also etymology of Wrocław . <\s>
<s> Folk etymology attributes the city name to a fisherman , Wars , and his wife , Sawa . <\s>
<s> According to legend , Sawa was a mermaid living in the Vistula River with whom Wars fell in love . <\s>
<s> In actuality , Warsz was a 12th/13th-century nobleman who owned a village located at the modern-day site of Mariensztat neighbourhood . <\s>
<s> See also the Vršovci family which had escaped to Poland . <\s>
<s> The official city name in full is miasto stołeczne Warszawa . <\s>
<s> A native or resident of Warsaw is known as a Varsovian – in Polish warszawiak , warszawianka , warszawiacy . <\s>
<s> The first fortified settlements on the site of today 's Warsaw were located in Bródno and Jazdów . <\s>
<s> After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes , a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa . <\s>
<s> The Prince of Płock , Bolesław II of Masovia , established this settlement , the modern-day Warsaw , in about 1300 . <\s>
<s> In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia , becoming the official capital of Masovian Duchy in 1413 . <\s>
<s> 14th-century Warsaw 's economy rested on mostly crafts and trade . <\s>
<s> Upon the extinction of the local ducal line , the duchy was reincorporated into the Polish Crown in 1526 . <\s>
<s> In 1529 , Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm , permanent from 1569 . <\s>
<s> In 1573 the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation , formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . <\s>
<s> Due to its central location between the Commonwealth 's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius , Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596 . <\s>
<s> In the following years the town expanded towards the suburbs . <\s>
<s> Several private independent districts were established , the property of aristocrats and the gentry , which were ruled by their own laws . <\s>
<s> Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish , Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces . <\s>
<s> Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1796 , when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia to become the capital of the province of South Prussia . <\s>
<s> Liberated by Napoleon 's army in 1806 , Warsaw was made the capital of the newly created Duchy of Warsaw . <\s>
<s> Following the Congress of Vienna of 1815 , Warsaw became the centre of the Congress Poland , a constitutional monarchy under a personal union with Imperial Russia . <\s>
<s> The Royal University of Warsaw was established in 1816 . <\s>
<s> Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918 . <\s>
<s> The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914 , which included Warsaw . <\s>
<s> Germany did so , and underground leader Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic , with Warsaw the capital . <\s>
<s> In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920 , the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city in which the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated . <\s>
<s> Poland stopped by itself the full brunt of the Red Army and defeated an idea of the `` export of the revolution '' . <\s>
<s> After the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began the Second World War , Warsaw was defended till September 27 . <\s>
<s> Central Poland , including Warsaw , came under the rule of the General Government , a German Nazi colonial administration . <\s>
<s> All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw 's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand , some 30 % of the city – herded into the Warsaw Ghetto . <\s>
<s> The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe . <\s>
<s> When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler 's `` Final Solution '' on 19 April 1943 , Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising . <\s>
<s> Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered , the Ghetto held out for almost a month . <\s>
<s> When the fighting ended , almost all survivors were massacred , with only a few managing to escape or hide . <\s>
<s> By July 1944 , the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward Warsaw . <\s>
<s> Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland , the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived . <\s>
<s> Thus , on 1 August 1944 , as the Red Army was nearing the city , the Warsaw Uprising began . <\s>
<s> The armed struggle , planned to last 48 hours , was partially successful , however it went on for 63 days . <\s>
<s> Eventually the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate . <\s>
<s> They were transported to PoW camps in Germany , while the entire civilian population was expelled . <\s>
<s> Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000 . <\s>
<s> After World War II , under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets , the `` Bricks for Warsaw '' campaign was initiated , and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage , along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city , such as the Palace of Culture and Science , a gift from the Soviet Union . <\s>
<s> The city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country 's centre of political and economic life . <\s>
<s> Many of the historic streets , buildings , and churches were restored to their original form . <\s>
<s> In 1980 , Warsaw 's historic Old Town was inscribed onto UNESCO 's World Heritage list . <\s>
<s> John Paul II 's visits to his native country in 1979 and 1983 brought support to the budding solidarity movement and encouraged the growing anti-communist fervor there . <\s>
<s> In 1979 , less than a year after becoming pope , John Paul celebrated Mass in Victory Square in Warsaw and ended his sermon with a call to `` renew the face '' of Poland : Let Thy Spirit descend ! Let Thy Spirit descend and renew the face of the land ! This land ! These words were very meaningful for the Polish citizens who understood them as the incentive for the democratic changes . <\s>
<s> Warsaw lies in east-central Poland about 300 km from the Carpathian Mountains and about 260 km from the Baltic Sea , 523 km east of Berlin , Germany . <\s>
<s> The city straddles the Vistula River . <\s>
<s> It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain , and its average elevation is 100 metres above sea level . <\s>
<s> The highest point on the left side of the city lies at a height of 115.7 metres , on the right side – 122.1 metres . <\s>
<s> The lowest point lies at a height 75.6 metres . <\s>
<s> There are some hills located within the confines of the city – e.g. Warsaw Uprising Hill , Szczęśliwice hill . <\s>
<s> Warsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations : the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces . <\s>
<s> The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw , which divides the city into two parts , left and right . <\s>
<s> The left one is situated both on the moraine plateau and on the Vistula terraces . <\s>
<s> The significant element of the relief , in this part of Warsaw , is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment . <\s>
<s> It is 20 to 25 m high in the Old Town and Central district and about 10 m in the north and south of Warsaw . <\s>
<s> It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark . <\s>
<s> The plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of clay pits . <\s>
<s> The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical . <\s>
<s> The left side consist mainly of two levels : the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one the flood plain terrace . <\s>
<s> The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground depressions with water systems coming from the Vistula old – riverbed . <\s>
<s> They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches . <\s>
<s> The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms . <\s>
<s> There are several levels of the plain Vistula terraces and only small part and not so visible moraine escarpment . <\s>
<s> Aeolian sand with a number of dunes parted by peat swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace . <\s>
<s> These are mainly forested areas . <\s>
<s> Warsaw 's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country . <\s>
<s> During the Second World War , Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction . <\s>
<s> After liberation , rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL . <\s>
<s> Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed . <\s>
<s> However , some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s . <\s>
<s> Mass residential blocks were erected , with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries . <\s>
<s> Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications . <\s>
<s> The most significant buildings are St. John 's Cathedral , the temple is a typical example of the so-called Masovian gothic style , St. Mary 's Church , a town house of Burbach family , Gunpowder Tower and the Royal Castle Curia Maior . <\s>
<s> The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family , building called `` The Negro '' and Salwator tenement . <\s>
<s> The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle and the Jesuit Church at Old Town . <\s>
<s> Among the first structures of the early baroque the most important are St. Hyacinth 's Church and Sigismund 's Column . <\s>
<s> Building activity occurred in numerous noble palaces and churches during the later decades of the 17th century . <\s>
<s> One of the best examples of this architecture are Krasiński Palace , Wilanów Palace and St. Kazimierz Church . <\s>
<s> The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace , Palace of the Four Winds and Visitationist Church . <\s>
<s> The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period . <\s>
<s> Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water , Królikarnia , Carmelite Church and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church . <\s>
<s> The economic growth during the first years of Congress Poland caused a rapid rise architecture . <\s>
<s> The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture , the most notable are the Great Theater and buildings located at Bank Square . <\s>
<s> Exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style . <\s>
<s> Despite that the Warsaw University of Technology building is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture . <\s>
<s> Some 19th-century buildings in the Praga district have been restored although many have been poorly maintained . <\s>
<s> Warsaw 's municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the Saxon Palace and the Brühl Palace , the most distinctive buildings in prewar Warsaw . <\s>
<s> There are also many places commemorating the heroic history of Warsaw . <\s>
<s> Pawiak , an infamous German Gestapo prison now occupied by a Mausoleum of Memory of Martyrdom and the museum , is only the beginning of a walk in the traces of Heroic City . <\s>
<s> The Warsaw Citadel , an impressive 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the November Uprising , was a place of martyr for the Poles . <\s>
<s> Another important monument , the statue of Little Insurgent located at the ramparts of the Old Town , commemorates the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the Warsaw Uprising , while the impressive Warsaw Uprising Monument by Wincenty Kućma was erected in memory of the largest insurrection of World War II . <\s>
<s> The Saxon Garden , covering the area of 15.5 ha , was formally a royal garden . <\s>
<s> There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax . <\s>
<s> At the east end of the park , the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated . <\s>
<s> In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior . <\s>
<s> Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period : maidenhair tree , black walnut , Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees . <\s>
<s> With its benches , flower carpets , a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids , the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians . <\s>
<s> The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here . <\s>
<s> The Łazienki Park covers the area of 76 ha . <\s>
<s> The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture and vegetation . <\s>
<s> What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants , which can be seen here walking around freely , and royal carps in the pond . <\s>
<s> The Wilanów Palace Park , dates back to the second half of the 17th century . <\s>
<s> It covers the area of 43 ha . <\s>
<s> Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient , baroque forms of the palace . <\s>
<s> The eastern section of the park , closest to the Palace , is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond . <\s>
<s> The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula . <\s>
<s> The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace . <\s>
<s> Other green spaces in the city include the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden . <\s>
<s> They have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants , while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world . <\s>
<s> Besides , within the city borders , there are also : Pole Mokotowskie , Park Ujazdowski , Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin , by the southern city border , Park Skaryszewski by the right Vistula bank , in Praga . <\s>
<s> The oldest park in Praga , the Praga Park , was established in 1865–1871 and designed by Jan Dobrowolski . <\s>
<s> In 1927 a zoological garden was established on the park grounds , and in 1952 a bear run , still open today . <\s>
<s> The flora of the city may be considered very rich in species . <\s>
<s> The species richness is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas as well as arable land , meadows and forests . <\s>
<s> Bielany Forest , located within the borders of Warsaw , is the remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest . <\s>
<s> Bielany Forest nature reserve is connected with Kampinos Forest . <\s>
<s> It is home to rich fauna and flora . <\s>
<s> Within the forest there are three cycling and walking trails . <\s>
<s> Other big forest area is Kabaty Forest by the southern city border . <\s>
<s> Warsaw has also two botanic gardens : by the Łazienki park as well as by the Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin . <\s>
<s> There are 13 natural reserves in Warsaw – among others , Bielany Forest , Kabaty Woods , Czerniaków Lake . <\s>
<s> About 15 kilometres from Warsaw , the Vistula river 's environment changes strikingly and features a perfectly preserved ecosystem , with a habitat of animals that includes the otter , beaver and hundreds of bird species . <\s>
<s> There are also several lakes in Warsaw – mainly the oxbow lakes , like Czerniaków Lake , the lakes in the Łazienki or Wilanów Parks , Kamionek Lake . <\s>
<s> There are lot of small lakes in the parks , but only a few are permanent – the majority are emptied before winter to clean them of plants and sediments . <\s>
<s> Demographically , it was the most diverse city in Poland , with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants . <\s>
<s> In addition to the Polish majority , there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw . <\s>
<s> According to Russian census of 1897 , out of the total population of 638,000 , Jews constituted 219,000 . <\s>
<s> Warsaw 's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city 's total population . <\s>
<s> In 1933 , out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue . <\s>
<s> World War II changed the demographics of the city , and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw 's history . <\s>
<s> Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation . <\s>
<s> In 1939 , c. 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw , but in 1945 – only 420,000 . <\s>
<s> During the first years after the war , the population growth was c. 6 % , so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses . <\s>
<s> The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations : only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance were allowed to get the registration , hence halving the population growth in the following years . <\s>
<s> It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore . <\s>
<s> Throughout its existence , Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city . <\s>
<s> According to the 1901 census , out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2 % were Catholics , 35.7 % Jews , 5 % Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8 % Protestants . <\s>
<s> Eight years later , in 1909 , there were 281,754 Jews , 18,189 Protestants and 2,818 Mariavites . <\s>
<s> This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town . <\s>
<s> Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 . <\s>
<s> After the war , the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt . <\s>
<s> The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune . <\s>
<s> A city is also a commune – but with the city charter . <\s>
<s> Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt , however in the cities – burmistrz . <\s>
<s> Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements , i.e. tasks and privileges , which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats . <\s>
<s> An example of such entitlement is a car registration : a gmina can not register cars , this is a powiat 's task . <\s>
<s> In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki . <\s>
<s> Such cities are for example Lublin , Kraków , Gdańsk , Poznań . <\s>
<s> In Warsaw , its districts additionally have some of powiat 's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration . <\s>
<s> For example , the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own . <\s>
<s> But for instance the districts in Kraków do not have entitlements of powiat , so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type for all districts . <\s>

<s> Like many cities in Central and Eastern Europe , infrastructure in Warsaw suffered considerably during its time as an Eastern Bloc economy – though it is worth mentioning that the initial Three-Year Plan to rebuild Poland was a major success , but what followed was very much the opposite . <\s>

<s> The French and Indian War was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years ' War . <\s>
<s> The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France , with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France , as well as Native American allies . <\s>
<s> At the start of the war , the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers , compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies . <\s>
<s> The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . <\s>
<s> Long in conflict , the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756 , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict . <\s>
<s> The war was fought primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North . <\s>
<s> It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers , called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne and present-day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . <\s>
<s> The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . <\s>
<s> In 1755 , six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four-way attack on the French . <\s>
<s> None succeeded and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster ; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . <\s>
<s> British operations in 1755 , 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed , due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , and effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies . <\s>
<s> In 1755 , the British captured Fort Beauséjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia ; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians . <\s>
<s> Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley , Commander-in-Chief , North America , without direction from Great Britain . <\s>
<s> The Acadians , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty , were expelled . <\s>
<s> Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England . <\s>
<s> After the disastrous 1757 British campaigns , the British government fell . <\s>
<s> William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France . <\s>
<s> France concentrated its forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war . <\s>
<s> Between 1758 and 1760 , the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada . <\s>
<s> They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately Quebec . <\s>
<s> Though the British were later defeated at Sainte Foy in Quebec , the French ceded Canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty . <\s>
<s> The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict . <\s>
<s> France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain . <\s>
<s> It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to its ally Spain , in compensation for Spain 's loss to Britain of Florida . <\s>
<s> France 's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , confirming Britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America . <\s>
<s> The conflict is known by multiple names . <\s>
<s> In British America , wars were often named after the sitting British monarch , such as King William 's War or Queen Anne 's War . <\s>
<s> As there had already been a King George 's War in the 1740s , British colonists named the second war in King George 's reign after their opponents , and it became known as the French and Indian War . <\s>
<s> This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States , but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict , and that this was part of the Seven Years ' War , a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain . <\s>
<s> American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years ' War . <\s>
<s> Other , less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire . <\s>
<s> In Europe , the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War usually is not given a separate name . <\s>
<s> The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years ' War . <\s>
<s> `` Seven Years '' refers to events in Europe , from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763 . <\s>
<s> These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America , where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years , from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760 . <\s>
<s> The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley , with some also in Acadia . <\s>
<s> Fewer lived in New Orleans , Biloxi , Mississippi , Mobile , Alabama and small settlements in the Illinois Country , hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries . <\s>
<s> French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds , did business with local tribes , and often married Indian women . <\s>
<s> Traders married daughters of chiefs , creating high-ranking unions . <\s>
<s> British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent , from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north , to Georgia in the south . <\s>
<s> Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west , as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time their provincial charters were granted . <\s>
<s> While their population centers were along the coast , the settlements were growing into the interior . <\s>
<s> Nova Scotia , which had been captured from France in 1713 , still had a significant French-speaking population . <\s>
<s> Britain also claimed Rupert 's Land , where the Hudson 's Bay Company traded for furs with local tribes . <\s>
<s> In between the French and the British , large areas were dominated by native tribes . <\s>
<s> To the north , the Mi ' kmaq and the Abenaki were engaged in Father Le Loutre 's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia , Acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of Canada , as well as much of present-day Maine . <\s>
<s> The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of present-day Upstate New York and the Ohio Country , although the latter also included Algonquian-speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee , as well as Iroquoian-speaking Mingo . <\s>
<s> These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule , and were limited by them in authority to make agreements . <\s>
<s> Further south the Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawba , Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw , and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes . <\s>
<s> When war broke out , the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region , including the Huron , Mississauga , Ojibwa , Winnebago , and Potawatomi . <\s>
<s> The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations , and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758 . <\s>
<s> In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton , in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations . <\s>
<s> Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French , their primary trading partner and supplier of arms . <\s>
<s> The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict . <\s>
<s> It was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the `` other side '' of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements , as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare . <\s>
<s> At the start of the war , no French regular army troops were stationed in North America , and few British troops . <\s>
<s> New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine , companies of colonial regulars . <\s>
<s> The colonial government recruited militia support when needed . <\s>
<s> Most British colonies mustered local militia companies , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , to deal with native threats , but did not have any standing forces . <\s>
<s> Céloron 's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians . <\s>
<s> The expedition covered about 3,000 miles between June and November 1749 . <\s>
<s> It went up the St. Lawrence , continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario , crossed the portage at Niagara , and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie . <\s>
<s> At the Chautauqua Portage , the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River , which it followed to the site of present-day Pittsburgh . <\s>
<s> There Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country . <\s>
<s> Whenever he encountered British merchants or fur-traders , Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave . <\s>
<s> When Céloron 's expedition arrived at Logstown , the Native Americans in the area informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French . <\s>
<s> Céloron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers , which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany , the home of the Miami chief known as `` Old Briton '' . <\s>
<s> Céloron threatened `` Old Briton '' with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the British . <\s>
<s> `` Old Briton '' ignored the warning . <\s>
<s> Disappointed , Céloron returned to Montreal in November 1749 . <\s>
<s> In his extensively detailed report , Céloron wrote , All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French , and are entirely devoted to the English . <\s>
<s> I do n't know in what way they could be brought back . <\s>
<s> Even before his return to Montreal , reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris , each side proposing that action be taken . <\s>
<s> William Shirley , the expansionist governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , was particularly forceful , stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present . <\s>
<s> Conflicts between the colonies , accomplished through raiding parties that included Indian allies , had taken place for decades , leading to a brisk trade in European colonial captives from either side . <\s>
<s> In 1749 the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country . <\s>
<s> The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory , and construct a fort for their protection . <\s>
<s> But , as the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania , both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims . <\s>
<s> In 1750 Christopher Gist , acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company , explored the Ohio territory and opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown . <\s>
<s> He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians , through their `` Half-King '' Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative , agreed to terms that included permission to build a `` strong house '' at the mouth of the Monongahela River . <\s>
<s> By the late 17th century , the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley , and kept it as hunting ground by right of conquest . <\s>
<s> The War of the Austrian Succession formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle . <\s>
<s> The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe . <\s>
<s> The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were turned over to a commission to resolve , but it reached no decision . <\s>
<s> Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north , to the Ohio Country in the south , were claimed by both sides . <\s>
<s> The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean , where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland . <\s>
<s> On March 17 , 1752 , the Governor-General of New France , Marquis de la Jonquière , died and was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil . <\s>
<s> His permanent replacement , the Marquis Duquesne , did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post . <\s>
<s> The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade , an officer in the Troupes de la Marine . <\s>
<s> Langlade was given 300 men , including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa . <\s>
<s> His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron 's orders to cease trading with the British . <\s>
<s> On June 21 , the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany , capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the Miami nation , including Old Briton . <\s>
<s> He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some aboriginal members of the expedition . <\s>
<s> In the spring of 1753 , Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians . <\s>
<s> His orders were to protect the King 's land in the Ohio Valley from the British . <\s>
<s> Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier , but where Céloron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates , Marin constructed and garrisoned forts . <\s>
<s> He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie 's south shore . <\s>
<s> He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . <\s>
<s> Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf , designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . <\s>
<s> As he moved south , he drove off or captured British traders , alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson , a chief of the Mingo , who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion . <\s>
<s> He intensely disliked the French . <\s>
<s> Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf , he threatened the French with military action , which Marin contemptuously dismissed . <\s>
<s> The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York . <\s>
<s> The British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond , Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey , meaning `` He who does great things . '' <\s>
<s> He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area . <\s>
<s> In 1746 , Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois . <\s>
<s> Later he was commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia . <\s>
<s> They met at Albany , New York with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies . <\s>
<s> Mohawk Chief Hendrick , Speaker of their tribal council , insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion . <\s>
<s> When Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction , Chief Hendrick said that the `` Covenant Chain '' , a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown , was broken . <\s>
<s> Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company , which stood to lose money if the French held their claim . <\s>
<s> To counter the French military presence in Ohio , in October 1753 Dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old Major George Washington of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory . <\s>
<s> Washington left with a small party , picking up along the way Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter ; Christopher Gist , a company surveyor working in the area ; and a few Mingo led by Tanaghrisson . <\s>
<s> On December 12 , Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf . <\s>
<s> Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre , who succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after the latter died on October 29 , invited Washington to dine with him . <\s>
<s> Over dinner , Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country . <\s>
<s> Saint-Pierre said , `` As to the Summons you send me to retire , I do not think myself obliged to obey it . '' <\s>
<s> He told Washington that France 's claim to the region was superior to that of the British , since René-Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier . <\s>
<s> Even before Washington returned , Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point , where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort . <\s>
<s> Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrecœur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period , and Contrecœur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5 , 1754 . <\s>
<s> When these forces arrived at the fort on April 16 , Contrecœur generously allowed Trent 's small company to withdraw . <\s>
<s> He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne . <\s>
<s> After Washington had returned to Williamsburg , Dinwiddie ordered him to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work . <\s>
<s> While en route , Washington learned of Trent 's retreat . <\s>
<s> Since Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British , Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with the Mingo leader . <\s>
<s> Learning of a French scouting party in the area , Washington , with Tanaghrisson and his party , surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen . <\s>
<s> They killed many of the Canadians , including their commanding officer , Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk . <\s>
<s> The historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people . <\s>
<s> They had been inclined to support the French , with whom they had long trading relationships . <\s>
<s> One of Tanaghrisson 's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire . <\s>
<s> News of the two battles reached England in August . <\s>
<s> After several months of negotiations , the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French . <\s>
<s> They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition . <\s>
<s> Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock 's departure for North America . <\s>
<s> In response , King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755 . <\s>
<s> The British , intending to blockade French ports , sent out their fleet in February 1755 , but the French fleet had already sailed . <\s>
<s> Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept the French . <\s>
<s> An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July , 1754 . <\s>
<s> The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding . <\s>
<s> The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence . <\s>
<s> Braddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne . <\s>
<s> The expedition was a disaster . <\s>
<s> It was attacked by French and Indian soldiers ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs . <\s>
<s> Braddock called for a retreat . <\s>
<s> He was killed . <\s>
<s> Approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured . <\s>
<s> The remaining 500 British troops , led by George Washington , retreated to Virginia . <\s>
<s> Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War , Washington and Thomas Gage , played key roles in organizing the retreat . <\s>
<s> The French acquired a copy of the British war plans , including the activities of Shirley and Johnson . <\s>
<s> Shirley 's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by Shirley 's inexperience in managing large expeditions . <\s>
<s> In conjunction , Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara . <\s>
<s> As a response , Shirley left garrisons at Oswego , Fort Bull , and Fort Williams . <\s>
<s> Supplies for use in the projected attack on Niagara were cached at Fort Bull . <\s>
<s> Johnson 's expedition was better organized than Shirley 's , which was noticed by New France 's governor , the Marquis de Vaudreuil . <\s>
<s> He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio , and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley 's expected attack . <\s>
<s> When Johnson was seen as the larger threat , Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat . <\s>
<s> Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River , but Johnson had strongly fortified it , and Dieskau 's Indian support was reluctant to attack . <\s>
<s> The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry . <\s>
<s> The battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field . <\s>
<s> Johnson 's advance stopped at Fort William Henry , and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point , where they began the construction of Fort Carillon . <\s>
<s> Colonel Monckton , in the sole British success that year , captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755 , cutting the French fortress at Louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements . <\s>
<s> To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg , Nova Scotia 's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area . <\s>
<s> Monckton 's forces , including companies of Rogers ' Rangers , forcibly removed thousands of Acadians , chasing down many who resisted , and sometimes committing atrocities . <\s>
<s> More than any other factor , the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise . <\s>
<s> The Acadian resistance , in concert with native allies , including the Mi ' kmaq , was sometimes quite stiff , with ongoing frontier raids . <\s>
<s> Other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians , the only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757 . <\s>
<s> Following the death of Braddock , William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America . <\s>
<s> At a meeting in Albany in December 1755 , he laid out his plans for 1756 . <\s>
<s> In addition to renewing the efforts to capture Niagara , Crown Point and Duquesne , he proposed attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudière River to attack the city of Quebec . <\s>
<s> Bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others , including William Johnson and New York 's Governor Sir Charles Hardy , Shirley 's plan had little support . <\s>
<s> Newcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun , with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command . <\s>
<s> Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers France sent to North America . <\s>
<s> French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756 , led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de Lévis and Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque , all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession . <\s>
<s> During that time in Europe , on May 18 , 1756 , England formally declared war on France , which expanded the war into Europe , which was later to be known as the Seven Years ' War . <\s>
<s> Governor Vaudreuil , who harboured ambitions to become the French commander in chief , acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived . <\s>
<s> Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain , so he ordered an attack against the forts Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry . <\s>
<s> In the March Battle of Fort Bull , French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder . <\s>
<s> They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario , and endangered the Oswego garrison , already short on supplies . <\s>
<s> French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area , encouraging them to raid frontier settlements . <\s>
<s> This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers , with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action . <\s>
<s> The new British command was not in place until July . <\s>
<s> When he arrived in Albany , Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them . <\s>
<s> Montcalm took bold action against his inertia . <\s>
<s> Building on Vaudreuil 's work harassing the Oswego garrison , Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga , as if to presage another attack along Lake George . <\s>
<s> With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany , Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August . <\s>
<s> In the aftermath , Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners ' personal effects . <\s>
<s> The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables , which angered the Indians . <\s>
<s> Loudoun , a capable administrator but a cautious field commander , planned one major operation for 1757 : an attack on New France 's capital , Quebec . <\s>
<s> Leaving a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm , he began organizing for the expedition to Quebec . <\s>
<s> He was then ordered by William Pitt , the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies , to attack Louisbourg first . <\s>
<s> Beset by delays of all kinds , the expedition was finally ready to sail from Halifax , Nova Scotia in early August . <\s>
<s> In the meantime French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast , and a fleet outnumbering the British one awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg . <\s>
<s> Faced with this strength , Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry . <\s>
<s> French irregular forces harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757 . <\s>
<s> In January they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga . <\s>
<s> In February they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen Lake George , destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification . <\s>
<s> In early August , Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort , which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole . <\s>
<s> When the withdrawal began , some of Montcalm 's Indian allies , angered at the lost opportunity for loot , attacked the British column , killing and capturing several hundred men , women , children , and slaves . <\s>
<s> The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations ; as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to European carriers . <\s>
<s> Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping . <\s>
<s> The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot , the intendant of the territory . <\s>
<s> His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates . <\s>
<s> A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758 . <\s>
<s> While many parties to the conflict blamed others , the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle . <\s>
<s> Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence , with primary defenses at Carillon , Quebec , and Louisbourg , while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years . <\s>
<s> The British failures in North America , combined with other failures in the European theater , led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor , the Duke of Cumberland . <\s>
<s> Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning . <\s>
<s> He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun . <\s>
<s> He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757 . <\s>
<s> Pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops , supported by the provincial militias , aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France . <\s>
<s> Two of the expeditions were successful , with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces . <\s>
<s> The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon , in which 3,600 Frenchmen famously and decisively defeated Abercrombie 's force of 18,000 regulars , militia and Native American allies outside the fort the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga . <\s>
<s> Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac , including caches of supplies destined for New France 's western forts and furs destined for Europe . <\s>
<s> Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst , victor at Louisbourg . <\s>
<s> In the aftermath of generally poor French results in most theaters of the Seven Years ' War in 1758 , France 's new foreign minister , the duc de Choiseul , decided to focus on an invasion of Britain , to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland . <\s>
<s> The invasion failed both militarily and politically , as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France , and sent funds to Britain 's ally on the mainland , Prussia , and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay . <\s>
<s> In one piece of good fortune , some French supply ships managed to depart France , eluding the British blockade of the French coast . <\s>
<s> British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 , when they finally captured Ticonderoga , James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec , and victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south . <\s>
<s> The victory was made complete in 1760 when , despite losing outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy , the British were able to prevent the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides . <\s>
<s> In September 1760 , and before any hostilities erupted , Governor Vaudreuil negotiated from Montreal a capitulation with General Amherst . <\s>
<s> Amherst granted Vaudreuil 's request that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition , continued ownership of their property , and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes . <\s>
<s> The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war . <\s>
<s> The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763 , and war in the European theatre of the Seven Years ' War was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763 . <\s>
<s> The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique , which had been occupied by the British . <\s>
<s> France chose to cede the former , but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , along with fishing rights in the area . <\s>
<s> They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands ' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent . <\s>
<s> The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow . <\s>
<s> The British , for their part , were happy to take New France , as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar . <\s>
<s> Spain , which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba , also gained Louisiana , including New Orleans , from France in compensation for its losses . <\s>
<s> Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations . <\s>
<s> Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia , colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents . <\s>
<s> The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from Europe and the colonies further south . <\s>
<s> The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces , but many went to France , and some went to New Orleans , which they had expected to remain French . <\s>
<s> Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands ; these latter efforts were unsuccessful . <\s>
<s> Others migrated to places like Saint-Domingue , and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution . <\s>
<s> The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population . <\s>
<s> The French word `` Acadien '' evolved to `` Cadien '' , then to `` Cajun '' . <\s>
<s> Following the treaty , King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7 , 1763 , which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations . <\s>
<s> Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population , a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers . <\s>
<s> The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians . <\s>
<s> When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues , religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of `` popery '' ; the Act maintained French Civil law , including the seigneurial system , a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution . <\s>
<s> For many native populations , the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion , leading to their ultimate dispossession . <\s>
<s> The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes . <\s>
<s> Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory had modest repercussions , the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British , and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek , historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited . <\s>
<s> The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave . <\s>
<s> Most went to Cuba , including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine , although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico . <\s>
<s> Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force . <\s>
<s> In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction , and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion . <\s>
<s> A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity . <\s>
<s> Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton . <\s>
<s> With his mathematical insight , Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years . <\s>
<s> By the early 20th century , Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia . <\s>
<s> With modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light , particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms . <\s>
<s> The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed . <\s>
<s> Only four main interactions are known : in order of decreasing strength , they are : strong , electromagnetic , weak , and gravitational . <\s>
<s> High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction . <\s>
<s> Aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology . <\s>
<s> In Aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different `` natural places '' therein . <\s>
<s> Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone . <\s>
<s> He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their `` natural place '' , which led to `` natural motion '' , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . <\s>
<s> This theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows . <\s>
<s> The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it . <\s>
<s> Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target . <\s>
<s> This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general . <\s>
<s> The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei , who was influenced by the late Medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus . <\s>
<s> Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century . <\s>
<s> He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force , for example friction . <\s>
<s> Newton 's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force . <\s>
<s> This law is an extension of Galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force . <\s>
<s> Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium `` natural state '' in place of the Aristotelian idea of the `` natural state of rest '' . <\s>
<s> That is , the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity . <\s>
<s> By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity , Newton 's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities . <\s>
<s> Specifically , in systems where objects are moving with different velocities , it is impossible to determine which object is `` in motion '' and which object is `` at rest '' . <\s>
<s> In other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a Galilean transformation . <\s>
<s> For instance , while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity , the laws of physics do not change from being at rest . <\s>
<s> A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving . <\s>
<s> This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle . <\s>
<s> It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle 's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down . <\s>
<s> From the perspective of the person in the car , the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest : It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction . <\s>
<s> Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest , the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable . <\s>
<s> Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest . <\s>
<s> The concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , even those that are not strictly constant velocity . <\s>
<s> The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year . <\s>
<s> Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration , such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object , were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames . <\s>
<s> This is why , for example , astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth , and why Newton 's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments . <\s>
<s> If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself , it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia . <\s>
<s> This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame . <\s>
<s> This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity . <\s>
<s> Newton 's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass . <\s>
<s> Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements . <\s>
<s> However , while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics , there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass . <\s>
<s> General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass , but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity , it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales . <\s>
<s> With some justification , Newton 's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality ; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed . <\s>
<s> Newton 's Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects . <\s>
<s> The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies , and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body . <\s>
<s> Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body , the second body exerts a force −F on the first body . <\s>
<s> F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction . <\s>
<s> This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law , with F called the `` action '' and −F the `` reaction '' . <\s>
<s> The action and the reaction are simultaneous . <\s>
<s> This means that in a closed system of particles , there are no internal forces that are unbalanced . <\s>
<s> That is , the action-reaction force shared between any two objects in a closed system will not cause the center of mass of the system to accelerate . <\s>
<s> The constituent objects only accelerate with respect to each other , the system itself remains unaccelerated . <\s>
<s> Alternatively , if an external force acts on the system , then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system . <\s>
<s> Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls , this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces . <\s>
<s> As with other physical concepts , the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale . <\s>
<s> Through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics . <\s>
<s> Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is . <\s>
<s> Because of these characteristics , forces are classified as `` vector quantities '' . <\s>
<s> This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction . <\s>
<s> For example , when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object , it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result . <\s>
<s> If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force , the situation is ambiguous . <\s>
<s> For example , if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling , it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be . <\s>
<s> The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction . <\s>
<s> In this simple one-dimensional example , without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other . <\s>
<s> Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems . <\s>
<s> Historically , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out . <\s>
<s> Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction . <\s>
<s> When two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram . <\s>
<s> The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum , depending on the angle between their lines of action . <\s>
<s> However , if the forces are acting on an extended body , their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body . <\s>
<s> As well as being added , forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other . <\s>
<s> A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces , one pointing north , and one pointing east . <\s>
<s> Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force . <\s>
<s> Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions . <\s>
<s> This is because , for orthogonal components , the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors . <\s>
<s> Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other . <\s>
<s> Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient . <\s>
<s> Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable , since that force would then have only one non-zero component . <\s>
<s> Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two . <\s>
<s> Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction , generated between the object and the table surface . <\s>
<s> For a situation with no movement , the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration . <\s>
<s> The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object . <\s>
<s> A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces , using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances . <\s>
<s> For example , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the `` spring reaction force '' , which equals the object 's weight . <\s>
<s> Using such tools , some quantitative force laws were discovered : that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density ; Archimedes ' principle for buoyancy ; Archimedes ' analysis of the lever ; Boyle 's law for gas pressure ; and Hooke 's law for springs . <\s>
<s> These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his Three Laws of Motion . <\s>
<s> Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic . <\s>
<s> Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an `` absolute rest frame '' did not exist . <\s>
<s> Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest . <\s>
<s> This was contrary to Aristotle 's notion of a `` natural state '' of rest that objects with mass naturally approached . <\s>
<s> Simple experiments showed that Galileo 's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct . <\s>
<s> For example , if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow 's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity , Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it . <\s>
<s> Thus , in an Aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship . <\s>
<s> However , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it . <\s>
<s> Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls , the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls . <\s>
<s> Thus , no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity . <\s>
<s> A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction . <\s>
<s> In such a situation , a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force . <\s>
<s> This results in zero net force , but since the object started with a non-zero velocity , it continues to move with a non-zero velocity . <\s>
<s> Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force . <\s>
<s> However , when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion . <\s>
<s> The notion `` force '' keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics , though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the Schrödinger equation instead of Newtonian equations . <\s>
<s> This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes `` quantized '' , i.e. they appear in discrete portions . <\s>
<s> This is , of course , difficult to imagine in the context of `` forces '' . <\s>
<s> However , the potentials V or fields , from which the forces generally can be derived , are treated similar to classical position variables , i.e. , . <\s>
<s> However , already in quantum mechanics there is one `` caveat '' , namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable , but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the `` spin '' , and there is the Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables . <\s>
<s> Depending on the value of the spin , identical particles split into two different classes , fermions and bosons . <\s>
<s> If two identical fermions have a symmetric spin function the spatial variables must be antisymmetric , and vice versa , i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric . <\s>
<s> Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables , whereas for two bosons the correlation is strictly positive . <\s>
<s> In modern particle physics , forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons . <\s>
<s> With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum . <\s>
<s> The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force . <\s>
<s> Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be `` fundamental interactions '' . <\s>
<s> When particle A emits or absorbs virtual particle B , a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A ' exchanging by B . <\s>
<s> This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions . <\s>
<s> While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams . <\s>
<s> In a Feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram . <\s>
<s> Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram . <\s>
<s> World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices , and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines . <\s>
<s> Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and , in the case of virtual particle exchange , are absorbed at an adjacent vertex . <\s>
<s> All of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions . <\s>
<s> The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances , and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles , including nucleons and compound nuclei . <\s>
<s> The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses . <\s>
<s> All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions . <\s>
<s> For example , friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces , and the Pauli exclusion principle , which does not permit atoms to pass through each other . <\s>
<s> Similarly , the forces in springs , modeled by Hooke 's law , are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position . <\s>
<s> Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference . <\s>
<s> The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas . <\s>
<s> For example , Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation . <\s>
<s> Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism . <\s>
<s> In the 20th century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces are manifestations of matter interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons . <\s>
<s> This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation . <\s>
<s> The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism , but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete . <\s>
<s> A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics . <\s>
<s> Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything . <\s>
<s> Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor , but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory . <\s>
<s> What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton . <\s>
<s> Before Newton , the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects . <\s>
<s> Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object . <\s>
<s> Today , this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared , and points toward the center of the Earth . <\s>
<s> This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth 's surface is directly proportional to the object 's mass . <\s>
<s> Thus an object that has a mass of will experience a force . <\s>
<s> Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances . <\s>
<s> In particular , Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law . <\s>
<s> Further , Newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body . <\s>
<s> Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass and the radius of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration . <\s>
<s> In this equation , a dimensional constant is used to describe the relative strength of gravity . <\s>
<s> This constant has come to be known as Newton 's Universal Gravitation Constant , though its value was unknown in Newton 's lifetime . <\s>
<s> Not until 1798 was Henry Cavendish able to make the first measurement of using a torsion balance ; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing could allow one to solve for the Earth 's mass given the above equation . <\s>
<s> Newton , however , realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion , his law of gravity had to be universal . <\s>
<s> It was only the orbit of the planet Mercury that Newton 's Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain . <\s>
<s> Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet that would explain the discrepancies ; however , despite some early indications , no such planet could be found . <\s>
<s> When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury 's orbit and found that his theory added a correction , which could account for the discrepancy . <\s>
<s> This was the first time that Newton 's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative . <\s>
<s> Since then , and so far , general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity . <\s>
<s> In GR , gravitation is not viewed as a force , but rather , objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events . <\s>
<s> From the perspective of the object , all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever . <\s>
<s> It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object 's curved path . <\s>
<s> Thus , the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space , and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object . <\s>
<s> For example , a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola , as it is in a uniform gravitational field . <\s>
<s> Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line , slightly curved . <\s>
<s> The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as `` gravitational force '' . <\s>
<s> Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge , a rule of vector multiplication called Lorentz 's Law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field . <\s>
<s> The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge . <\s>
<s> This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force and the magnetic force . <\s>
<s> Fully stated , this is the law . <\s>
<s> The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations , which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs . <\s>
<s> These `` Maxwell Equations '' fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges , and the interactions of the fields themselves . <\s>
<s> This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be `` self-generating '' through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light . <\s>
<s> This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum . <\s>
<s> However , attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations , the photoelectric effect , and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe , proved troublesome . <\s>
<s> Through the work of leading theoretical physicists , a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics . <\s>
<s> This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics , which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons . <\s>
<s> In QED , photons are the fundamental exchange particle , which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force . <\s>
<s> It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force . <\s>
<s> However , these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle . <\s>
<s> Since electrons are fermions , they can not occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons . <\s>
<s> When the electrons in a material are densely packed together , there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all , so some of them must be in higher energy states . <\s>
<s> This means that it takes energy to pack them together . <\s>
<s> While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force , it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states . <\s>
<s> The strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles . <\s>
<s> However , a residual of the force is observed between hadrons as the nuclear force . <\s>
<s> Here the strong force acts indirectly , transmitted as gluons , which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons , which classically transmit the nuclear force . <\s>
<s> The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable . <\s>
<s> This phenomenon is called color confinement . <\s>
<s> The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons . <\s>
<s> Its most familiar effect is beta decay and the associated radioactivity . <\s>
<s> The word `` weak '' derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force . <\s>
<s> Still , it is stronger than gravity over short distances . <\s>
<s> A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed , which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins . <\s>
<s> Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big Bang . <\s>
<s> The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact . <\s>
<s> When their electron clouds overlap , Pauli repulsion follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects . <\s>
<s> The normal force , for example , is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object . <\s>
<s> An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface . <\s>
<s> Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless , frictionless , unbreakable , and unstretchable . <\s>
<s> They can be combined with ideal pulleys , which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction . <\s>
<s> Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string , any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object . <\s>
<s> By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys , the tension force on a load can be multiplied . <\s>
<s> For every string that acts on a load , another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load . <\s>
<s> However , even though such machines allow for an increase in force , there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load . <\s>
<s> These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine . <\s>
<s> Newton 's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects . <\s>
<s> However , in real life , matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object . <\s>
<s> For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow , contract , expand , or otherwise change shape , the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material . <\s>
<s> For example , in extended fluids , differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows . <\s>
<s> Where is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated . <\s>
<s> This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area . <\s>
<s> The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains including also tensile stresses and compressions . <\s>
<s> Torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position , angular velocity for velocity , and angular momentum for momentum . <\s>
<s> As a consequence of Newton 's First Law of Motion , there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque . <\s>
<s> Likewise , Newton 's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body . <\s>
<s> Where is the mass of the object , is the velocity of the object and is the distance to the center of the circular path and is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center . <\s>
<s> This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path . <\s>
<s> Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object , but only the direction of the velocity vector . <\s>
<s> The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path , and one that is tangential to the path . <\s>
<s> This yields both the tangential force , which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up , and the radial force , which changes its direction . <\s>
<s> A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms . <\s>
<s> This means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system . <\s>
<s> The force , therefore , is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space , and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area . <\s>
<s> For certain physical scenarios , it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials . <\s>
<s> This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates . <\s>
<s> For example , friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector . <\s>
<s> Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag . <\s>
<s> However , for any sufficiently detailed description , all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials . <\s>
<s> The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics . <\s>
<s> In macroscopic closed systems , nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system , and are often associated with the transfer of heat . <\s>
<s> According to the Second law of thermodynamics , nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases . <\s>
<s> The pound-force has a metric counterpart , less commonly used than the newton : the kilogram-force , is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass . <\s>
<s> The kilogram-force leads to an alternate , but rarely used unit of mass : the metric slug is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf . <\s>
<s> The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system , and is generally deprecated ; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight , jet thrust , bicycle spoke tension , torque wrench settings and engine output torque . <\s>
<s> Other arcane units of force include the sthène , which is equivalent to 1000 N , and the kip , which is equivalent to 1000 lbf . <\s>
